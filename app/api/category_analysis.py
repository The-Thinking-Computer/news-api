# Step 1: Semantic Analysis with Word Embeddings
word_embeddings_model = api.load("word2vec-google-news-300")

# Step 2: Concept Extraction
def extract_concepts(topic_words):
    topic_embeddings = [word_embeddings_model[word] for word in topic_words]
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=1)  # Adjust number of clusters as needed
    kmeans.fit(topic_embeddings)
    centroid = kmeans.cluster_centers_[0]
    # Find closest words to the centroid as representative concepts
    # You may need to post-process these words to ensure they are informative and relevant
    closest_words = word_embeddings_model.similar_by_vector(centroid, topn=5)
    return [word for word, _ in closest_words]

# Step 3: Contextual Understanding
# You may incorporate domain-specific knowledge or contextual cues here

# Step 4: Logical Inference and NLG
def generate_topic_name(topic_words):
    concepts = extract_concepts(topic_words)
    # Perform logical inference and NLG to generate topic name
    # You can use rules or templates to construct descriptive names based on the extracted concepts
    # Example: "Election and Political Events" or "Government Policies and Elections"
    return " and ".join(concepts)

# Step 5: Evaluation and Validation
# Evaluate the generated topic names based on human judgment or user feedback

# Example topic word-list
topic_name = generate_topic_name(topic_words)
print("Generated Topic Name:", topic_name)
