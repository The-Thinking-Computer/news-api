As we close 2023, OSIG remains committed to preserving the integrity of our public benefits programs and the trust that taxpayers put in the Commonwealth,\u201d said\u00a0State Inspector General Lucas M. Miller.\u00a0\u201cWe will continue to vigorously investigate and prosecute fraud, safeguarding resources for those who genuinely depend on public assistance.\u201d</p><p>Fraud cases involving public assistance given out by the Department of Human Services are investigated and prosecuted by OSIG based on tips about potential fraud or abuse of programs based on flagged applications, \u201cquestionable use of benefits\u201d and tips from the public. </p><p>Defendants charged with defrauding programs such as SNAP, cash assistance and subsidized daycare are disqualified from receiving those benefits. </p><p>Also, 566 of the 590 people involved had felony charges brought against them with misdemeanor charges being filed against the other 24. </p><p>If convicted, the defendants face up to seven years in prison and a fine of $15,000 in addition to the restitution. </p>",

Hamas wants an end to the war, withdrawal of all Israeli troops and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>Weeks of efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have so far not yielded a deal.

It says Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.</p><p>Gantz said Israel will evacuate the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Rafah before striking, but repeated his pledge that the offensive will take place during Ramadan if hostages are not released.</p><p>\u201cI repeat \u2014 if there is no outline for the (hostage) release, we will also operate during Ramadan,\u201d he said.</p><p>The U.S. and other members of the international community have urged Israel not to strike Rafah without a plan to protect civilians.</p><p>Ramadan is expected to begin around March 10.</p><p>GENEVA \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization says he hasn\u2019t spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a decade and will \u201cprobably\u201d make contact now, at a time when Israel\u2019s military campaign in Gaza has devastated medical facilities there.</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when asked about his contact with Netanyahu in recent months, said he had not been in touch with the Israeli leader since he served as Ethiopia\u2019s foreign minister in 2014.</p><p>\u201cSo probably I will take that as a recommendation and make contact,\u201d Tedros told a WHO news conference on Wednesday, noting that the organization\u2019s country office has been in contact with Israeli authorities.</p><p>Tedros has made repeated heartfelt statements on how Israel\u2019s war in Gaza has decimated the health sector. However, his comments Wednesday were the first time he publicly said he hasn\u2019t tried talking to Netanyahu about the how the war is being conducted.</p><p>Tedros, who led the U.N. health agency\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, has over the years met with many world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, before the pandemic was declared, and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza have repeatedly come under fire by Israel\u2019s military during the monthslong war. Israel has accused the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, of using medical facilities as cover for its operations.</p><p>WHO has listed a total of 754 \u201cattacks on health care\u201d \u2014 including strikes that hit ambulances, medical facilities, health care workers and any other attacks that affect the provision of health care \u2014 in occupied Palestinian areas since Oct. 7.</p><p>On Tuesday, WHO said 32 patients in critical condition had been transferred from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to other facilities in recent days, after the complex became \u201cnon-functional\u201d following an Israeli siege and military raid.</p><p>\u201cThe health and humanitarian situation in Gaza is inhumane and continues to deteriorate,\u201d Tedros said in his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p><p>GENEVA \u2014 Switzerland will ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the government said Wednesday.</p><p>Under the ban, Swiss authorities can more easily apply preventative measures to deny entry or expel anyone suspected of affiliation with Hamas, and exchange information with foreign authorities more openly in cases of suspected terrorism financing linked to the group.</p><p>The Federal Council, Switzerland\u2019s seven-member executive branch, said the ban will affect Hamas and any potential successor organizations. The Swiss government already listed Hamas as a terror organization just days after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.</p><p>Acts of support for Hamas could be punishable with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, depending on the level of influence in the group, the government said in a statement. However, the ban so far is limited to five years, but it can be extended by parliament.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 Israel\u2019s parliament has given overwhelming approval to a declaration expressing opposition to international efforts to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.</p><p>Wednesday\u2019s vote, approved by 99 of 120 lawmakers, is not binding but reflects the widespread sentiment in Israel as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza for a fifth month. Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p><p>\u201cIsrael outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,\u201d it says.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p><p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu\u2019s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel \u2014 The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of \u201csystematic and intentional\u201d rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p><p>The report said that \u201cin some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.\u201d Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p><p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report\u2019s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on \u201cconfidential sources\u201d but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places \u2013 the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT \u2014 Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday\u2019s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p><p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza\u2019s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p><p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel\u2019s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p><p>The war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p><p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip \u2014 The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p><p>\u201cWhile details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,\u201d the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months\u2019 worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations\u2019 World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys \u201cfaced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,\u201d according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>\u201cIn these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,\u201d the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas\u2019 government media office described the WFP decision as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert \u201ccatastrophic consequences of the famine\u201d there.</p><p>Yemen\u2019s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels\u2019 standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military\u2019s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don\u2019t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p><p>LONDON \u2014 Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the \u201cterrible human cost\u201d since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the \u201cdesperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.\u201d</p><p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William\u2019s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>\u201cSometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,\u2019\u2019 William said.</p><p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p><p>\u201cEven in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,\u2033 William said. \u201cI continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.\u201d</p><p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p><p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas\u2019 surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel\u2019s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p><p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p><p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions \u201cwould help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,\u201d the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p><p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not \u201can effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen \u2014 which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.\u201d</p>",

        "data": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Trying to keep up with customer demand, Batesville Tool &amp; Die began seeking 70 people to hire last year. It wasn\u2019t easy. Attracting factory workers to a community of 7,300 in the Indiana countryside was a tough sell, especially having to compete with big-name manufacturers nearby like Honda and Cummins Engine.</p><p>Job seekers were scarce.</p><p>\u201cYou could count on one hand how many people in the town were unemployed,\u201d said Jody Fledderman, the CEO. \u201cIt was just crazy.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Batesville Tool &amp; Die managed to fill just 40 of its vacancies.</p><p>Enter the robots. The company invested in machines that could mimic human workers and in vision systems, which helped its robots \u201csee\u201d what they were doing.</p><p>The Batesville experience and others like it have been replicated countlessly across the United States for the past couple of years. Chronic worker shortages have led many companies to invest in machines to do some of the work they can\u2019t find people to do. They\u2019ve also been training the workers they do have to use advanced technology so they can produce more with less.</p><p>The result has been an unexpected productivity boom, which helps explain a great economic mystery: How has the world\u2019s largest economy managed to remain so healthy, with brisk growth and low unemployment, despite brutally high interest rates that are intended to tame inflation but that typically cause a recession? </p><p>To economists, strong productivity growth provides an almost magical elixir. When companies roll out more efficient machines or technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost their profits and raise their employees\u2019 pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check.</p><p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has likened surging productivity to \u201cmagic beanstalk beans for the economy. \u2026 You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.\u2019\u2019</p><p>Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm RSM, said, \u201cThe last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s.\u201d</p><p>That was when a productivity surge \u2014 an early payoff from the sudden embrace of laptops, cellphones and the internet \u2014 helped allow the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates low because inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market sizzled.</p><p>This time, the Fed\u2019s aggressive streak of rate hikes \u2014 11 of them starting in March 2022 \u2014 has managed to help cool inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1% while causing little economic hardship.</p><p>\u201cI would have said it\u2019s not possible,\u2019\u2019 said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what happened.\u2019\u2019</p><p>A year ago, nearly every economist was warning that a recession was all but inevitable. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself warned in 2022 that beating inflation would inflict \u201csome pain\u201d in the form of widespread layoffs and higher unemployment.</p><p>By last month, Powell was sounding a different note. With unemployment barely above a half-century low, the Fed chair told reporters, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very strong labor market, and we\u2019ve had inflation coming down.\u201d</p><p>He did caution that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. Yet the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its 2% goal that it hasn\u2019t raised rates since July and is expected to cut rates multiple times this year.</p><p>Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool &amp; Die have managed to achieve in the past year or so. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed\u2019s 2% target. That would mean that today\u2019s roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Yet higher productivity has changed that equation: There\u2019s now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation.</p><p>\u201cA lot of that pressure on business finances \u2014 that normally causes them to raise prices \u2014 has been offset by strong productivity growth,\u2019\u2019 Guatieri said.</p><p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing steadily even while inflation has tumbled.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to look at it \u2014 yeah,\u201d Powell replied.</p><p>The productivity boom marks a sharp shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged around a tepid 1.5%, according RSM\u2019s calculations. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. Parts shortages arose.</p><p>Desperate, many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago. Labor productivity rose at a 3.6% annual pace from last April through June, 4.9% from July through September and 3.2% from October through December.</p><p>At Reata Engineering &amp; Machine Works, \u201cefficiency was kind of forced on us,\u2019\u2019 CEO Grady Cope said. With the job market roaring, the company, based in Englewood, Colorado, couldn\u2019t hire fast enough. Meantime, its customers were starting to balk at paying higher prices.</p><p>So Reata installed robots and other technology to produce more with less. Software allowed it to automate the delivery of price quotes to customers. That process used to require two weeks. Now, it can be done in 24 hours. </p><p>Many economists and business people say they\u2019re hopeful, if not certain, that the productivity boom can continue. Artificial intelligence, they note, is only beginning to penetrate factory floors, warehouses, stores and offices.</p><p>\u201cRight now, AI is not a critical enabler for us; it\u2019s an assistant and accelerator in certain roles,\u2019\u2019 said Peter Doyle, CEO of Hirsh Precision, which makes parts for the aerospace and medical device industries. \u201cThe world is still trying to understand what AI is capable of doing and how quickly it will advance.\u2019\u2019</p><p>The early evidence suggests that AI could sustain the productivity gains. A study last year by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tracked 5,200 customer-support agents at a Fortune 500 company who used a generative AI-based assistant in 2020 and 2021. The AI tool provided suggestions for dealing with customers and links to useful internal documents.</p><p>Those using the chatbot were found to be 14% more productive than colleagues who didn\u2019t use the tool. They handled more calls and completed them faster. The biggest gains in productivity \u2014 34% \u2014 came from the least-experienced, least-skilled workers.</p><p>Automation tends to raise fears that machines will replace human workers and thereby kill jobs. Some workers supplanted by robots do often struggle to find new work and end up settling for lower pay. </p><p>Yet history suggests that in the long run, technological improvements actually create more jobs than they destroy. People are needed to build, upgrade, repair and operate sophisticated machines. Some displaced workers are trained to shift into such jobs. And that transition is likely to be eased this time by the retirement of the vast baby boom generation, which is causing labor shortages.</p><p>Some of today\u2019s productivity gains may be coming not just from advanced technology but also from more satisfied workers. The tight labor markets of the past three years allowed Americans to change jobs and find others that pay better and make them happier and more productive.</p><p>One of them was Justin Thompson, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, who had felt burned out by his job as a police officer, with its 16-hour workdays .</p><p>\u201cI was literally running myself into the ground,\u2019\u2019 he said.</p><p>Thompson\u2019s wife saw a job posting for operations manager at a charter airline. Even without airline experience, his wife felt he could use skills he gains as a Marine Corps infantryman \u2014 handling logistics for missions \u2014 during tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>She was right. Omni Air International hired him in 2019.</p><p>Thompson, 43, said he he loves the new job, which allows him to work from home when he\u2019s not traveling. And his Marine experience \u2014 which included developing ways to improve efficiency \u2014 has proved invaluable. Technology helps, too: Thompson travels with a laptop, iPad and mobile printer and uses proprietary software to manage logistics.</p><p>Other workers have switched from low-skill jobs to those that pay better and are more productive.</p><p>\u201cThe people who were rolling tacos on Dec. 31, 2019 \u2026 yeah, they\u2019ve moved up,\u2019\u2019 RSM\u2019s Brusuelas said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing other things and making a lot more money.\u201d</p><p>At Reata Engineering, staffers were trained to use new sophisticated equipment. One 19-year-old employee, a university engineering student, has used AI tools to make company training materials less cumbersome and time-consuming.</p><p>\u201cThe whole point is not to lay people off,\u2019\u2019 said Cope, the CEO of Reata Engineering. \u201cThe point is to make people do jobs that are more interesting\u2019\u2019 \u2014 and pay better, too.</p>",

He said two others who got injured were in stable condition. Singh died after clashes between security forces and farmers erupted in Khanauri, a town in the state of Punjab, reported PTI.</p><p>Punjab\u2019s shared borders with the state of Haryana have become protest sites for the farmers attempting to reach New Delhi. The majority of the protesting farmers are from the two states.</p><p>Haryana police in a post on X, formerly Twitter, said 12 officers were injured after protesters attacked them with sticks and pelted them with stones. The post added that protesters used chili powder to set stubble on fire, making it difficult for the officers to breathe. </p><p>Last week, the farmers paused their protest and hunkered down near the town of Shambhu, close to the border between Punjab and Haryana, as their unions engaged in discussions with government ministers. They rejected a proposal offering them five-year contracts of guaranteed prices on a set of certain crops, including maize, grain legumes and cotton, and decided to resume their march on Wednesday.</p><p>Authorities are set on containing the demonstration, which has renewed the movement from over two years ago when tens of thousands of farmers camped out on the outskirts of the city for over a year, forcing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal new agriculture laws in a major reversal for his government.</p><p>Last week, authorities barricaded highways leading to New Delhi with cement blocks, metal containers, barbed wire and iron spikes to prevent the farmers from entering. On Wednesday, the farmers arrived at the barricades with bulldozers and excavators to try and push through.</p><p>Jagjit Singh Dallewal, one of the farmers leading the march, said they did not want any violence, but condemned the federal government over the massive security measures.</p><p>\u201cWe want to reach New Delhi in a peaceful manner. The government should remove the barricades,\u201d he said.</p><p>The protest organizers say the farmers are seeking new legislation that would guarantee minimum prices for 23 crops. The farmers believe this would help stabilize their income. They are also pressing the government to follow through on promises to waive loans and withdraw legal cases brought against them during the earlier 2021 protests.</p><p>The government protects agricultural producers against sharp falls in farm prices by setting a minimum purchase price for certain essential crops, a system that was introduced in the 1960s to help shore up food reserves and prevent shortages. The system can apply up to 23 crops, but the government usually offers the minimum price only for rice and wheat.</p><p>Several talks so far have failed to break the deadlock. But Arjun Munda, one of the ministers negotiating with the farmers, said they were willing to hold another round of discussions and that the government wanted to maintain peace.</p><p>The protests come at a crucial time for India, which is gearing up for national election in the coming months, with Modi\u2019s ruling party widely expected to secure a third successive term.</p><p>\u201cIt is the prime minister\u2019s responsibility, who has been elected with majority votes, to handle the situation and accept our demands,\u201d Sarwan Singh Pandher, a farm leader, told PTI.</p><p>The farmers are an influential voting bloc and particularly important to Modi\u2019s base \u2014 especially in Northern Haryana and several other states with a substantial farming population, where his Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys wide support. </p><p>___</p><p>Pathi reported from New Delhi.</p>",

        "data": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off Saturday in South Carolina\u2019s first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary, the first head-to-head matchup for the last two remaining major candidates since the New Hampshire primary a month ago.</p><p>The contest takes place on Haley\u2019s home turf. She was South Carolina\u2019s governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base.</p><p>Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet. Haley has increasingly questioned Trump\u2019s fitness for office, most recently criticizing his comments on Russia and NATO. It is a marked contrast from earlier in the campaign when she and other GOP hopefuls avoided criticizing Trump directly.</p><p>The South Carolina primary is usually an indicator of which candidate will win the Republican presidential nomination. Since the modern version of the state\u2019s primary began in 1980, all but one GOP primary winner has gone on to win the party\u2019s nomination. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.</p><p>A look at what to expect on election night:</p><p>The primary will be held Saturday and polls will close statewide at 7 p.m. EST.</p><p>The ballot will list Ryan Binkley, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, David Stuckenberg, and Trump.</p><p>South Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party\u2019s primary. But voters may only participate in one party\u2019s presidential primary, so people who voted in the Democratic primary on Feb. 3 may not vote in the Republican contest.</p><p>Only about 4% of registered voters cast ballots in the Democratic contest, leaving the bulk of the electorate, including any Democrats and independents who favor Haley over Trump and didn\u2019t vote in the earlier contest, eligible to weigh in on the Republican race.</p><p>There are 50 delegates at stake and 29 will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Twenty-one delegates will be allocated according to the vote in each of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts. The top vote-getter in each district will get three delegates from that district. </p><p>The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state\u2019s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics.</p><p>Republican electoral politics have changed dramatically since the last time Haley and Trump each faced other Republican candidates in the Palmetto State. Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday\u2019s primary. </p><p>In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley\u2019s strongest showings and some of Trump\u2019s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections. </p><p>Trump carried 44 of the state\u2019s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. </p><p>Haley\u2019s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump.</p><p>The results are broadly consistent with Haley\u2019s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states\u2019 Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas.</p><p>These results suggest that Haley\u2019s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state\u2019s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties.</p><p>The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it\u2019s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.</p><p>There are about 3.3 million registered voters in South Carolina. Voters do not register by party. Turnout in the 2016 Republican primary was about 25% of registered voters. It was about 22% in the 2012 primary.</p><p>Saturday\u2019s contest will be the first Republican presidential primary held in the state since a new early voting law was enacted in May 2022. The law allows voters to cast ballots in-person before Election Day without an excuse. </p><p>The early voting period for the GOP primary is Feb. 12-22, excluding Feb. 18-19. In the 2016 Republican primary, when voters had to provide an excuse to cast an absentee ballot, about 8% of votes were cast before Election Day. In the 2022 midterm primaries, after the new law went into effect, pre-Election Day voting was at about 21%. About 36% of votes cast in the Feb. 3 Democratic primary were before Election Day.</p><p>As of Tuesday night, more than 139,000 voters had cast their ballots.</p><p>In the 2024 South Carolina Democratic primary, the AP first reported results at 7:08 p.m. EST.</p><p>Primary night tabulation ended at 10:47 p.m. EST with nearly 100% of votes counted.</p><p>As of Saturday, there will be 142 days until the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee and 255 until the November general election.</p>",

The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges.</p><p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted EPA\u2019s authority to fight air and water pollution \u2014 including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited EPA\u2019s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine mandate and blocked President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program.</p><p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. </p><p>A lawyer for the EPA said the \u201cgood neighbor\u201d rule was important to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states. Besides the potential health impacts, the states face their own federal deadlines to ensure clean air, said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, representing the EPA.</p><p>States such as Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut can struggle to meet federal standards and reduce harmful levels of ozone because of pollution from power plants, cement kilns and natural gas pipelines that drift across their borders.</p><p>Judith Vale, New York\u2019s deputy solicitor general, said as much as 65% of some states\u2019 smog pollution comes from out of state.</p><p>The EPA plan was intended to provide a national solution to the problem of ozone pollution, but challengers said it relied on the assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would participate. </p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying the EPA plan could impose unreasonable costs on states that remain under its authority, because it was initially designed for 23 states.</p><p>\u201cEPA came back and said, \u2018Even if we have fewer states, we\u2019re going to plow ahead anyway,\u201d\u2019 Kavanaugh said. \u201cLet\u2019s just kind of pretend nothing happened and just go ahead with the 11 states.\u201d</p><p>The EPA proceeded \u201cwithout a whole lot of explanation, and nobody got a chance to comment on that\u201d as part of the rule-making process, added Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p><p>\u201cWhat (states) are asking for is simply an opportunity to make the argument before the agency,\u2033 said Chief Justice John Roberts.</p><p>Stewart responded that requirements for states to control air pollution don\u2019t change based on the number of states subject to the rule. \u201cThe requirements are exactly the same,\u201d he said.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why the Supreme Court was hearing the case before the other legal challenges were completed. A lawyer for industry groups challenging the rule said it imposes significant and immediate costs that could affect the reliability of the electric grid.</p><p>\u201cThere are hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, in costs over the next 12 to 18 months,\u201d with only a small reduction in air pollution and no guarantee the final rule will be upheld, said industry lawyer Catherine Stetson. \u201cThere are over-control issues here,\u201d she said.</p><p>The EPA has said power-plant emissions dropped by 18% in 2023 in the 10 states where it has been allowed to enforce its rule, which was finalized last March. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. In California, limits on emissions from industrial sources other than power plants are supposed to take effect in 2026.</p><p>The rule is on hold in another dozen states because of separate legal challenges. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.</p><p>States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites don\u2019t add significantly to air pollution in other states. In cases where a state has not submitted a \u201cgood neighbor\u201d plan \u2014 or where EPA disapproves a state plan \u2014 the federal plan was supposed to ensure that downwind states are protected.</p><p>Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Environmental and public health advocates have praised the EPA plan as a life-saving measure for people who live hundreds of miles away from power plants, cement factories, steel mills and other industrial polluters.</p><p>Industry groups criticize it as having an anti-coal bias that would drive up the cost of electricity.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this story.</p>",

(AP) \u2014 A prosecutor said Wednesday that a New Hampshire man accused of killing his 5-year-old daughter treated her like a thing he\u2019d broken and needed to throw away. But his lawyer said he wasn\u2019t guilty of her death though he made terrible decisions to hide and move her body to keep his family together. </p><p>Jurors heard closing arguments before starting deliberations in the two-week trial of Adam Montgomery on a second-degree murder charge in the case of his daughter, Harmony Montgomery. Police first learned the girl was missing in December 2021 and later said she was killed, though her body was never found.</p><p>In closing arguments, defense attorney Caroline Smith said Montgomery moved the body and hid it because of \u201ca very misguided belief\u201d he had to do so \u201cto keep his family from being ripped apart.\u201d </p><p>But prosecutor Benjamin Agati told jurors a different story. He said Montgomery, 34, was angry that his daughter was having bathroom accidents inside the car they were living in after they were evicted from their home. He said Montgomery punched her in the head until she died. </p><p>\u201cAll he has is his car, and his rage, and his fists,\u201d Agati said, later adding, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get a headstone in the ground above the head that he battered. She doesn\u2019t get to be at peace and death because of what he did, because he can\u2019t afford to tell anyone where she is.\u201d</p><p>Harmony\u2019s mother, Crystal Sorey, cried and at times covered her ears as Agati spoke in court. </p><p>Adam Montgomery is serving a 30-year prison sentence for an unrelated gun conviction and has not attended trial. He said in court in an unrelated case last year that he loves Harmony \u201cunconditionally\u201d and did not kill her. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. </p><p>Montgomery\u2019s attorneys have acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he \u201cpurposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed\u201d her corpse and falsified physical evidence.</p><p>Montgomery also faced charges of assaulting his daughter in 2019 \u2014 giving her a black eye \u2014 and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, who is Harmony\u2019s stepmother.</p><p>Investigators believe Harmony was murdered in December 2019, though she wasn\u2019t reported missing for nearly two years. Kayla Montgomery testified the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had custody of Harmony. Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony was on a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year\u2019s Eve 2021. </p><p>Photos of Harmony were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. She was not given immunity, but acknowledged to defense lawyers that she hasn\u2019t faced further consequences for inconsistencies in her statements to police or prosecutors.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony in the head because the girl had wet herself. She said her family, including the couple\u2019s two young sons, had been evicted and were living in their car. According to Kayla, Adam punched Harmony at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant on the morning of Dec. 7, 2019.</p><p>She also testified about handing food to the children without checking on Harmony, the subsequent discovery that Harmony was dead, and the places her husband hid the body, including in a ceiling vent at a homeless shelter and the walk-in freezer at his workplace. </p><p>Kayla testified her husband drove away with Harmony\u2019s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn\u2019t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021. </p><p> Toll data shows the truck crossed a major bridge in Boston multiple times. Last year, police searched a marshy area in Revere, Massachusetts, without finding Harmony\u2019s body.</p><p>Adam Montgomery\u2019s attorneys said that the only person who knew how Harmony died \u2014 Kayla \u2014 was lying. They said that Harmony actually died the night before Kayla said she did, and that Kayla was alone with her at the time. </p><p>\u201cShe was an instigator and equal partner,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe did not influence her. She influenced him, and most importantly, he did not kill his daughter.\u201d</p><p>But Agati described Kayla as \u201ca battered woman admitting an inconvenient and terrible truth that she failed in a moment of life when her character was put to the test. She did nothing to help Harmony, nothing to stop her. She didn\u2019t kill her. Only the defendant did that.\u201d </p>",

Another vehicle drove off the east bridge abutment and landed on its roof. There were injuries but no one died.</p><p>After investigators presented their findings, three members of the National Transportation Safety Board agreed that poor inspections and insufficient oversight were among the probable causes of the collapse.</p><p>\u201cThe Fern Hollow Bridge collapse should never have happened,\u201d NTSB chair Jennifer L. Homendy said, describing the incident as a wake-up call. </p><p>Homendy cited extensive corrosion to the uncoated weathering steel and \u201crepeated failures to act\u201d on damage to the bridge that was known for years. In some areas, the steel had deteriorated to the point of visible holes in the structure.</p><p>\u201cThe city of Pittsburgh was responsible for inspecting and maintaining the Fern Hollow bridge,\u201d said NTSB senior structural engineer Dan Walsh. \u201cSimilar maintenance and repair recommendations were made in the inspection reports for more than 15 years leading up to the collapse. But the city failed to act on them, resulting in progressive corrosion to the point of failure.\u201d</p><p>The office of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said the administration does not dispute the NTSB findings and noted the bridge inspections were performed by consultants. The city has created a new Bridge Maintenance Division and increased funding for bridge maintenance and repairs by 300%.</p><p>Pittsburgh communications director Maria Monta\u00f1o said in an email that the city has since examined inspection reports for all the bridges it owns \u201cand has been working diligently to address all critical tasks identified in those reports.\u201d She said most \u201chigh priority\u201d tasks have been resolved or are in the process, and the city has reviewed all of its bridges\u2019 \u201cfracture critical\u201d components and made sure they are draining properly.</p><p>Four people were injured, two of them severely, when the bridge collapsed just hours before President Joe Biden arrived in Pittsburgh to promote spending on infrastructure. </p><p>Attorney Steve Barth, who represents bus driver Daryl Luciani in litigation against the city and engineers involved with the bridge, said the NTSB findings confirmed what his own experts had concluded.</p><p>Barth said there were \u201cmultiple levels of failure, from data collection, recording that data, implementation of any recommendations and then oversight.\u201d</p><p>There are at least six lawsuits involving the bridge collapse, Barth said. Luciani needed shoulder surgery, had back and neck injuries and is dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, Barth said. The accident required Luciani to be out on worker\u2019s compensation for a lengthy period, his lawyer said.</p><p>Monta\u00f1o declined to comment on the pending litigation.</p><p>The presentations expanded on findings released by the NTSB last May, when investigators said drainage problems led to the deterioration of the structure\u2019s legs and that debris, dirt and leaves had not been cleared.</p><p>The old bridge was about 50 years old when it collapsed and had been under a 26-ton (24,000 kilograms) posted weight limit, with annual inspections required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since 2014. Investigators said a more accurate inspection would have reduced that to about 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilos), which may have required its closure. </p><p>The board played an animation of the collapse along with video from the bus, operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, now known as Pittsburgh Regional Transit. It showed the harrowing moments when the bridge began to fail and then dropped.</p><p>The failure began when a steel tie-plate on the bridge\u2019s southwestern leg gave way because of corrosion and structural loss, said NTSB senior accident investigator Dennis Collins. The city also made improper load calculations, in part because paving records did not show the asphalt was twice as thick as inspectors believed, he said.</p><p>The city\u2019s bridge inspection program did not identify all of the structure\u2019s essential \u201cfracture critical sections\u201d that would require closer monitoring, Collins said.</p><p>Steel cables were added to shore up the bridge in 2009, but they were intended as a temporary solution and a long-term fix was not completed.</p><p>A new bridge at the site 5 miles (8 kilometers) east of downtown Pittsburgh opened to traffic in December 2022. </p>",

(AP) \u2014 A large Alabama hospital has paused in vitro fertilization treatments as health care providers weigh the impact of a state court ruling that frozen embryos are the legal equivalent of children.</p><p>The University of Alabama at Birmingham said in a statement Wednesday that its UAB Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility has paused the treatments \u201cas it evaluates the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s decision that a cryopreserved embryo is a human being.\u201d </p><p>\u201cWe are saddened that this will impact our patients\u2019 attempt to have a baby through IVF, but we must evaluate the potential that our patients and our physicians could be prosecuted criminally or face punitive damages for following the standard of care for IVF treatments,\u201d the statement emailed by spokeswoman Savannah Koplon read. </p><p>Other fertility treatment providers in the state were continuing to provide IVF as lawyers explored the impact of the ruling. </p><p>The ruling by the all-Republican Alabama Supreme Court prompted a wave of concern about the future of IVF treatments in the state and the potential unintended consequences of extreme anti-abortion laws in Republican-controlled states. Patients called clinics to see if scheduled IVF treatments would continue. And providers consulted with attorneys.</p><p>Justices \u2014 citing language in the Alabama Constitution that the state recognizes the \u201crights of the unborn child\u201d \u2014 said three couples could sue for wrongful death when their frozen embryos were destroyed in a accident at a storage facility.</p><p> \u201cUnborn children are \u2018children\u2019 \u2026 without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics,\u201d Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in Friday\u2019s majority ruling by the all-Republican court. </p><p>Mitchell said the court had previously ruled that a fetus killed when a woman is pregnant is covered under Alabama\u2019s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act and nothing excludes \u201cextrauterine children from the Act\u2019s coverage.\u201d</p><p>The ruling brought a rush of warnings about the potential impact on fertility treatments and the freezing of embryos, which had previously been considered property by the courts. Groups representing both IVF treatment providers and patients seeking fertility treatments raised alarm about the decision. </p><p>And patients were left wondering where it would leave them.</p><p>Gabby Goidel, 26, who is pursuing IVF treatment in Alabama after three miscarriages, told The Associated Press that the court ruling came down on the same day she began daily injections ahead of egg retrieval.</p><p>\u201cIt just kind of took me by by storm. It was like all I could think about, and it was just a very stressful thing to hear. I immediately messaged my clinic and asked if this could potentially halt us. They said we have to take it one day at a time,\u201d Goidel said.</p><p>Barbara Collura, the CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, told the AP Tuesday that the ruling raises questions for providers and patients, including if they can freeze future embryos created during fertility treatment or if patients could ever donate or destroy unused embryos. </p><p>The Alabama Supreme Court decision partly hinged on anti-abortion language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018, stating it is the \u201cpolicy of this state to ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.\u201d</p><p>Eric Johnston, an anti-abortion activist and lawyer who helped draft the constitutional language, said the \u201cpurpose of that was more related to abortion.\u201d He said it was intended to clarify that the Alabama Constitution does not protect the right to abortion and eventually laid the groundwork for Alabama to ban abortions when states regained control of abortion access.</p><p>\u201cModern science has raised up this question about well is a fertilized egg that is frozen \u2014 is that a person? And that\u2019s the ethical, medical, legal dilemma that we\u2019ve got right now. \u2026 It\u2019s a very complicated issue,\u201d Johnston said.</p><p>However, opponents of the constitutional amendment warned in 2018 that it was essentially a personhood measure that could give rights to fertilized eggs. </p>",

Boatman said investigators will forward the results of that probe to the local district attorney to determine what, if any, charges should be filed.</p><p>When asked if the students involved in the fight could be charged with a hate crime, Boatman said: \u201cAll crimes and charges will be on the table.\u201d</p><p>School officials in Owasso, a suburb about 13 miles (20 kilometers) northeast of Tulsa, said in a statement a physical altercation occurred in a restroom and that students were in the restroom for less than two minutes before the fight was broken up by other students and a staff member.</p><p>After the fight, each of the students \u201cwalked under their own power to the assistant principal\u2019s office and the nurse\u2019s office,\u201d and school officials recommended to the parent of one of the students involved that they visit a medical facility for further examination.</p><p>Police said they were not notified of the altercation until the student arrived at the hospital, and that a report was taken at that time. Police said the student was rushed back to the hospital the following day, Feb. 8, and was pronounced dead.</p><p>Oklahoma\u2019s Republican-led Legislature has passed several new laws targeting transgender and nonbinary people in recent years, including bills that prohibit children from receiving gender-affirming medical care and prohibiting the use of nonbinary gender markers on birth certificates.</p><p>Gov.

Janet Mills, a Democrat, called for the changes in January in a speech that came three months after an Army reservist killed 18 people in the worst mass shooting in the history of the state. The reservist had a h istory of mental illness and erratic behavior before the shootings.</p><p>Mills said there is broad support for the kind of changes in her proposals, which would also establish a violence-prevention program at the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The proposals would need to find support in a state with a higher percentage of gun ownership than most of the Northeast.</p><p>\u201cThey are practical, common-sense measures that are Maine-made and true to our culture and our longstanding traditions while meeting today\u2019s needs. They represent meaningful progress, without trampling on anybody\u2019s rights, and they will better protect public safety,\u201d Mills said.</p><p>One of Mills\u2019 proposals would strengthen the state\u2019s extreme risk protection order law. Some law enforcement personnel have said the state\u2019s yellow flag law made it difficult to remove shooter Robert Card\u2019s weapons despite clear warning signs. Mills said her change would allow law enforcement to seek a protective custody warrant to take a dangerous person into custody to remove weapons.</p><p>Another proposal would extend the National Instant Criminal Background Check System to advertised, private sales of firearms. Still another would incentivize the checks for unadvertised, private sales.</p><p>The proposals would also establish a statewide network of crisis receiving centers so that a person suffering a mental health crisis could get care swiftly, Mills said. </p><p>The governor\u2019s supplemental budget includes other proposals geared at crisis response and mental health. It also proposes to create a Maine mass violence care fund with $5 million to cover physical and mental health expenses connected to a mass violence event and not covered by insurance.</p><p>\u201cOur community\u2019s difficult healing process will continue long into the future, and this will provide folks with the support they need when they need it,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Kristen Cloutier of Lewiston.</p><p>Card committed the shootings at a bowling alley and restaurant in Lewiston on Oct. 25. He was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot. </p><p>Card had been well known to law enforcement for months before the shootings, and a fellow reservist told an Army superior that Card was going to \u201csnap and do a mass shooting.\u201d</p>",

Florida officials designated the money for increasing security of the state\u2019s voter registration system. Elsewhere, federal money has been used to replace voting machines and add cybersecurity staff.</p><p>Most of that was allocated ahead of the 2020 election, as states rushed to boost cybersecurity defenses, and has been exhausted. A separate $400 million was required to be spent on pandemic-related election costs in 2020.</p><p>The last chunk of election-related funding was $75 million approved by Congress in December 2022. State allocations ranged from $5.8 million for California to $1 million for Nevada.</p><p>\u201cLos Angeles elections alone costs $75 million,\u201d said Kathy Boockvar, the former chief elections official in Pennsylvania. \u201cI don\u2019t think election officials have had expectations of $400 million. People have hoped for $75 million, and it\u2019s unclear whether even that will come.\u201d</p><p>Federal budget negotiations have been mired in partisan disputes, with agencies mostly operating on spending levels approved for 2023. Congress has been able to approve only temporary funding plans, which cover a few months at a time. The next deadline is March 1, when the most recent temporary funding plan expires for some departments and a week later for others. The government faces a potential shutdown if new funding is not approved.</p><p>Even if a deal is reached, there\u2019s no guarantee of new money for elections. House Republicans last year listed election security grants as \u201cwasteful spending\u201d and did not allocate money for it in their spending proposal. Instead, they have been focused on legislation that would ban private organizations from providing money to election offices.</p><p>\u201cAmericans deserve to have confidence in our elections, which means elections should be free from undue private influence,\u201d U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the Committee on House Administration, said at a recent hearing.</p><p>A $75 million Senate proposal for election security is being negotiated as part of the final spending package.</p><p>\u201cAdministering free and fair elections is year-round work that takes planning and resources, and election officials on the front lines of our democracy need a steady stream of funding so that they can do things like replace aging equipment, strengthen cybersecurity, and keep pace with new technology,\u201d U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said in a statement.</p><p>In North Carolina, state election officials have had to make some tough decisions as the needs have outpaced state and federal funding.</p><p>North Carolina\u2019s State Board of Elections has reduced its cybersecurity staff by one employee and has been forced to cut back in other areas to meet some of the needs for election security, said Karen Brinson Bell, the agency\u2019s executive director. A team of six employees that had been handling election data has been reduced to just one full-time position, with another person helping part-time. Some eliminated positions were funded by federal grants that are no longer available.</p><p>\u201cEvery effort we\u2019ve put forward for cybersecurity has come through federal funding, and without that continuous funding and no new funding through the (North Carolina) legislature, it\u2019s hard to sustain a strong cyber posture,\u201d Brinson Bell said.</p><p>During its recent meeting, the National Association of Secretaries of State passed a resolution calling on Congress to provide sufficient money to help officials address cybersecurity threats.</p><p>West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican, said he does not support federal money for elections because \u201ctypically, it comes with strings attached.\u201d</p><p>Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, also a Republican, said he would welcome federal assistance for cybersecurity needs if there was flexibility on how states spent it.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily mind a partnership there with some funding, as long as states are the ones that have the ability to spend those dollars \u2014 because what happens in Mississippi may be a little bit different than Minnesota or Maine or California,\u201d Watson said.</p><p>Kim Wyman, the former secretary of state in Washington, said federal officials should heed the lessons of the 2000 election \u2014 when some election offices were well-funded and others less so. She said the Help America Vote Act of 2002, approved by Congress in the aftermath of the ballot confusion in Florida, leveled the playing field with $3.2 billion in federal money going to the states. A similar investment is needed now, she said.</p><p>Wisconsin election officials have used previous federal money to provide grants to local election offices that have helped them boost their technology support and training. They also have been able to buy new voting equipment and mail ballot envelopes, said Meagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission.</p><p>New Mexico has used federal money to help cover the costs of its election security program. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, said election officials need predictability.</p><p>\u201cWhen we create programs, we want to be able to sustain those programs, not just for a year or for two years. We want to sustain them for the long term,\u201d she said.</p><p>In Minnesota, the state has used federal money to create grants for local election officials for voting system upgrades, including electronic pollbooks and tabulators. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said he was concerned about the lack of federal funding and the message that sends about the nation\u2019s priorities.</p><p>\u201cNobody I know is looking for Congress to fund state elections,\u201d said Simon, a Democrat. \u201cWhat we are looking for \u2013 for election security and other purposes \u2014 is for them to be a partner in helping us to fill some gaps.\u201d</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP) \u2014 A Tennessee free-market nonprofit group on Wednesday joined the ranks of organizations challenging a new Biden administration labor rule that changes the criteria for classifying workers as independent contractors or employees.</p><p>The Beacon Center of Tennessee filed its federal lawsuit in Nashville on behalf of two freelance journalists, Margaret Littman and Jennifer Chesak. The lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Labor, its wage division and two top officials claims the new rule will \u201cforce freelancers to enter undesirable employment relationships or to refrain from working at all.\u201d</p><p>Others are also challenging the rule, including business coalitions in an ongoing case before the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a group of freelance writers represented by a libertarian legal organization who sued in a Georgia federal court.</p><p>The rule replaces a Trump-era standard regarding classification of employees as contractors. Such workers are not guaranteed minimum wages or benefits, such as health coverage and paid sick days. The new rule aims to prevent the misclassification of workers as independent contractors.</p><p>President Joe Biden\u2019s administration proposed the rule change in October 2022, approved it in January and set it to go into effect on March 11.</p><p>Labor advocates have supported the rule, saying employers have exploited lax rules to misclassify workers and avoid properly compensating them. Business groups contend that the rule creates uncertainty for employers and that much depends on how the Labor Department decides to enforce it.</p><p>The Beacon Center\u2019s lawsuit argues that the Labor Department lacks the authority to change the rule and didn\u2019t provide a reasoned explanation for it as required by the federal Administrative Procedure Act. Additionally, the group argues that the rule increases the chances that freelancers like Littman and Chesak will be misclassified as employees instead of contractors. </p><p>In Chesak\u2019s case, the lawsuit says one company has begun requiring her to spend unpaid hours documenting her tasks as a freelancer; another company has limited the hours she can work as a freelancer; and another has required her to sign an agreement that indemnifies the company if it were found liable for misclassifying her.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve chosen to be a freelance writer for nearly 30 years because of the flexibility, control, and opportunity it provides me,\u201d Littman said in a news release. \u201cI\u2019m fighting back against the Labor Department\u2019s rule because it threatens to destroy my livelihood and right to earn a living as a freelancer.\u201d </p><p>The rule directs employers to consider six criteria for determining whether a worker is an employee or a contractor, without predetermining whether one outweighs the other. That\u2019s a change from the Trump-era rule, which prioritized two criteria: how much control a company has over its workers and how much \u201centrepreneurial opportunity\u201d the work provides.</p><p>It\u2019s up to employers initially to decide how to weigh each criteria, which also include how much control the employer has over the worker, whether the work requires special skills, the nature and length of the work relationship of the relationship between worker and employer, and the investment a worker makes to do the work, such as car payments.</p><p>Major app-based platforms including Uber and Lyft have expressed confidence that the new rule would not force them to reclassify their gig drivers. The two companies are also listed as members of one of the business coalitions challenging the rule in court.</p>",

Rochester is much closer to the centerline, and will spend over twice the amount of time in darkness\u20143 minutes and 40 seconds.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_photo\">\n<div class=\"photo\" data-module=\"photo\">\n<div class=\"photo__image\">\n<div class=\"photo__ratio-enforcer\">\n<div class=\"photo__ratio-enforced\">\n<img class=\"photo__placeholder\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_16x9.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"photo__main\" loading=\"eager\" onload=\"this.style.opacity=1\" src=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1140x641.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_16x9.jpg 16w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_140x79.jpg 140w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_360x203.jpg 360w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_540x304.jpg 540w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_750x422.jpg 750w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1920x1080.jpg 1920w\" style=\"opacity:0\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photo__meta\">\n<div class=\"photo__credit\">Credit: Michael Zeiler | GreatAmericanEclipse.com</div>\n<div class=\"photo__caption\">The closer to the centerline of the path of totality, the longer you will experience darkness.</div>\n</div>\n</div> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>Williamsport will be in 96% totality.

        "data": "<p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) \u2014 A prosecutor said Wednesday that a New Hampshire man accused of killing his 5-year-old daughter treated her like a thing he\u2019d broken and needed to throw away. But his lawyer said he wasn\u2019t guilty of her death though he made terrible decisions to hide and move her body to keep his family together. </p><p>Jurors heard closing arguments before starting deliberations in the two-week trial of Adam Montgomery on a second-degree murder charge in the case of his daughter, Harmony Montgomery. Police first learned the girl was missing in December 2021 and later said she was killed, though her body was never found.</p><p>The jury deliberated for about two hours Wednesday before recessing for the day. </p><p>In closing arguments earlier in the day, defense attorney Caroline Smith said Montgomery moved the body and hid it because of \u201ca very misguided belief\u201d he had to do so \u201cto keep his family from being ripped apart.\u201d </p><p>But prosecutor Benjamin Agati told jurors a different story. He said Montgomery, 34, was angry that his daughter was having bathroom accidents inside the car they were living in after they were evicted from their home. He said Montgomery punched her in the head until she died. </p><p>\u201cAll he has is his car, and his rage, and his fists,\u201d Agati said, later adding, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t get a headstone in the ground above the head that he battered. She doesn\u2019t get to be at peace and death because of what he did, because he can\u2019t afford to tell anyone where she is.\u201d</p><p>Harmony\u2019s mother, Crystal Sorey, cried and at times covered her ears as Agati spoke in court. </p><p>Adam Montgomery is serving a 30-year prison sentence for an unrelated gun conviction and has not attended trial. He said in court in an unrelated case last year that he loves Harmony \u201cunconditionally\u201d and did not kill her. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. </p><p>Montgomery\u2019s attorneys have acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he \u201cpurposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed\u201d her corpse and falsified physical evidence.</p><p>Montgomery also faced charges of assaulting his daughter in 2019 \u2014 giving her a black eye \u2014 and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, who is Harmony\u2019s stepmother.</p><p>Investigators believe Harmony was murdered in December 2019, though she wasn\u2019t reported missing for nearly two years. Kayla Montgomery testified the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had custody of Harmony. Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony was on a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year\u2019s Eve 2021. </p><p>Photos of Harmony were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. She was not given immunity, but acknowledged to defense lawyers that she hasn\u2019t faced further consequences for inconsistencies in her statements to police or prosecutors.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony in the head because the girl had wet herself. She said her family, including the couple\u2019s two young sons, had been evicted and were living in their car. According to Kayla, Adam punched Harmony at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant on the morning of Dec. 7, 2019.</p><p>She also testified about handing food to the children without checking on Harmony, the subsequent discovery that Harmony was dead, and the places her husband hid the body, including in a ceiling vent at a homeless shelter and the walk-in freezer at his workplace. </p><p>Kayla testified her husband drove away with Harmony\u2019s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn\u2019t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021. </p><p> Toll data shows the truck crossed a major bridge in Boston multiple times. Last year, police searched a marshy area in Revere, Massachusetts, without finding Harmony\u2019s body.</p><p>Adam Montgomery\u2019s attorneys said that the only person who knew how Harmony died \u2014 Kayla \u2014 was lying. They said that Harmony actually died the night before Kayla said she did, and that Kayla was alone with her at the time. </p><p>\u201cShe was an instigator and equal partner,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe did not influence her. She influenced him, and most importantly, he did not kill his daughter.\u201d</p><p>But Agati described Kayla as \u201ca battered woman admitting an inconvenient and terrible truth that she failed in a moment of life when her character was put to the test. She did nothing to help Harmony, nothing to stop her. She didn\u2019t kill her. Only the defendant did that.\u201d </p>",

        "data": "<p>SCRANTON, Pa. \u2014 We are exactly 2 months out from the spectacle of a lifetime: a total solar eclipse! On April 8th, the Sun, Moon, and Earth will align in a complete cosmic calibration. As the moon moves between the Sun and Earth, it will cast a shadow on a vast part of Earth's Western Hemisphere, including the entire U.S.\u00a0</p><p>All 50 states will see at least a <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/why-partial-eclipses-are-worth-seeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partial eclipse</a>, when the sun appears as a crescent shape or as if the moon has \"taken a bite out of the sun.\" An estimated <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">652 million people</a> live in an area that will be able to see the partial eclipse.</p><p>Along a narrow <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~100 mile long strip of land</a> stretching from Mexico, northeast through Texas, Illinois, and all the way up to Maine and Newfoundland, the moon will completely cover the sun.\u00a0</p><p>Here, revelers will experience totality, and will stand fully within the Moon's <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4517/#:~:text=The%20lunar%20umbra%20is%20the,experience%20a%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>umbra</em></a>, or inner shadow. Many large U.S. cities will be plunged into darkness during the middle of the day. San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Montr\u00e9al, and Burlington (VT), all fall along the path of totality. Here in our area, the closest cities on that path of totality are Erie, Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse. Only 0.5% of the world's population, or <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/dhs/solar-eclipse-2024/faqs/#:~:text=Although%20the%20sky%20will%20darken,April%202024%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">43 million people</a> (including populations from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), are lucky enough to live along this path.</p><p>During totality, clouds permitting, you will be able to witness a gaping \"hole\" in the sky (the moon covering the sun), a white halo around the sun called the <em>corona</em>, or the sun\u2019s outer atmosphere, a 360\u00b0 panoramic sunset, and planets and stars become visible in the middle of the day. Since we are <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-maximum-expected-2024-new-predictions-suggest\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approaching a solar maximum</a>, based upon the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased number of sunspots on the surface of the sun</a>, the corona will likely appear bright, sharp, and pointed, whereas during the 2017 Great American Total Solar Eclipse, the sun was far from the peak of its activity cycle, and the corona appeared thin and wispy.\u00a0</p><p>If skies remain cloudy during totality, it may still be possible to witness the corona, if the clouds are thin enough. If the cloud deck is too thick, you will not be able to see the eclipsed sun, but you will still experience several other environmental changes.\u00a0</p><p>During totality, regardless of clouds, temperature drops as we cover our light source, <a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/temperature-change-during-totality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes as much as 10-20\u00b0</a>. Animals and insects act strange in the moments leading up to, during, and following totality. Birds swarm and squawk in the minutes before totality, and fall silent during the darkness. Bees return to the hive, cows go back to the barn, chickens roost, and fish come up to the surface. During an eclipse, some people even act peculiar: there are reports of some bursting out into tears as they feel an enormous sense of overwhelming emotions during totality.</p><p>In the moments immediately preceding and following totality, some fascinating optical phenomena can occur. Since the moon is not a perfect sphere, right before totality, the last few rays of light pass through the deep valleys on its surface. The result is a string of glowing \"beads\" of light called <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/this-date-in-science-bailys-beads-discovered/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baily's Beads</em></a>, which disappear one by one as those valleys cover the sun. In the final 10 seconds prior to totality, just one brightly glowing bead remains, called the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/resource/putting-a-ring-on-it-2017-total-solar-eclipse/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Diamond Ring</em></a>.\u00a0</p><p>On the ground, shadows sharpen and become more detailed as more and more of the sun becomes obscured. Within minutes of totality, fast-moving, undulating, thin waves of light and dark called <a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eclipse-america/eclipse-experience#:~:text=Shadow%20Bands%20Very%20dim%2C%20undulating,totality%20and%2For%20immediately%20after.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>shadow bands</em></a> can flow across the Earth's surface, a product of the interaction of the dwindling light from the sun and Earth's atmospheric perturbations.</p><p>All of Central and Northeastern Pennsylvania will see over 92% totality. You will notice a significant diminution of light, and the day will take on an eerie tint as the sun is reduced to a slim crescent. Temperatures will definitely drop by several degrees. Animals will begin to prepare for night. But none of the <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/what-to-expect/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">optical phenomena described above</a>\u2014Baily's Beads, the Diamond Ring, shadow bands, the corona, or full darkness\u2014will be visible here.</p><p>If you are in Scranton, there will be a deep partial eclipse, with approximately 95% totality. The closest city within the path of totality is Syracuse\u2014just a 2 hour drive from Scranton. There you will be able to stand in darkness for 1 minute and 27 seconds. Since Syracuse is on the outer fringes of the path of totality, full coverage of the sun won't last as long. The closer to the centerline of the totality band you can position yourself, the longer time you can spend in totality. Rochester is much closer to the centerline, and will spend over twice the amount of time in darkness\u20143 minutes and 40 seconds.</p><p>Williamsport will be in 96% totality. It is a 2 hour and 30 minute drive to Rochester, a 3 hour and 15 minute drive to Buffalo, and a 4 hour drive to Erie. All three cities will see about 3 minutes and 40 seconds of totality just after 3 PM EDT. Other locations' coverage percentage and time in darkness can be found by plotting points on <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/map/2024-april-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this map</a>.</p><p>Unless during totality, it is NEVER safe to look directly at the sun without the proper eye protection. You can damage your retinas. In order to view a solar eclipse safely, you must use special ISO 12312-2 certified eclipse glasses, which be purchased in stores and online, but be careful of fakes which lack the certification on the inside arm of the paper glasses. Visit the American Astronomical Society website for a <a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">list of reputable solar eclipse viewer and filter vendors</a>.</p><p>Total solar eclipses only happen once every 1 to 2 years, and each traces a unique path along a different part of Earth, often over the ocean or land where there is low population density. For any given point on the planet, the path of totality only aligns <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-eclipse-1973\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on average once every 375 years</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2026-august-12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">next total solar eclipse</a> will take place in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain on August 12, 2026. Excluding an eclipse only visible in <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2033-march-30\">Alaska in 2033</a>, the next time a total solar eclipse will be visible within in the United States at all will be <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2044-august-23\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 years from now</a>, and the path of totality only inches its way into the Northern Plains (Montana, North &amp; South Dakota). The <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2045-august-12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">next total solar eclipse</a> that will streak its way across the entire United States won\u2019t be until 2045.

McDougal had been arrested in multiple counties, including Harris, Montgomery and Liberty, on various charges, including assault of a public servant, resisting arrest and drug possession. In 2007, McDougal was convicted of enticing a minor with intent in Brazoria County but Sheriff Lyons said he didn't have to register as a sex offender.\u00a0</p><p>McDougal served two years in prison in Huntsville between September 2020 and September 2022, according to court records.\u00a0</p><p>During the search for Audrii, McDougal was taken into custody on an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge. According to court documents, McDougal stabbed a man in the back last August. McDougal and a woman the victim knew came to his home to ask for help and claimed his car battery was dead. The victim was jumping the car when McDougal stabbed him from behind, according to court records.</p><p>After Audrii went missing, the victim recognized McDougal as his alleged attacker and contacted the Polk County Sheriff's Office. They charged McDougal and locked him up in jail while the search for Audrii continued.\u00a0</p><p>Before Audrii's body was found, McDougal was identified by authorities as the \"main person of interest.\" They said he answered questions and even told investigators where he visited on the day of Audrii's disappearance. They found a wet backpack believed to be Audri's at one of those locations.</p><p>In a news conference on Monday, Lyons said McDougal was likely the last person to see Audrii alive and said McDougal admitted to leaving the house with her.</p><p>Lyons also confirmed that McDougal has ties to the Aryan Brotherhood.\u00a0</p><p>McDougal was charged with capital murder in Audrii's death on Wednesday and is being held without bond.\u00a0</p><p><strong>KHOU 11 on social media:<em>\u00a0</em></strong><a href=\"http://facebook.com/KHOU11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KHOU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> | <a href=\"https://instagram.com/khou11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXwRxm0zS0jBNTMOVI6xZJw\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a></p>",

Each loan listed on the page should have a repayment plan listed.<br/><br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>The SAVE plan is designed to be the go-to IDR plan for most student borrowers going forward.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/nfridrriapra.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulation which establishes SAVE</a> is worded as revisions to the preexisting REPAYE plan, a plan that is available for new borrowers every year.\u00a0</p><p>New student borrowers entering repayment will only have the option of enrolling in the standard 10-year repayment plan, the SAVE plan or another program called the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/31149/ED_Releases_Final_Rule_on_Latest_Income-Driven_Repayment_Plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASFAA</a> says.</p><p>That will mean SAVE and IBR will be the only two IDR plans going forward. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan will be sunsetted as of July 1, 2024, NASFAA says. Once they\u2019re sunsetted, only borrowers currently enrolled in those plans will be permitted to remain on them.</p><p>The IBR plan has a couple of differences from SAVE that might make it more appealing to certain borrowers. Unconsolidated Stafford loans and FFEL loans are <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#eligible-loans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eligible for IBR</a>, and borrowers with graduate loans who are on IBR plans can have their\u00a0<a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#repayment-period\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">loans forgiven after 20 years</a>, the Education Department says. People with graduate loans have to make payments for 25 years before their loans are forgiven with SAVE.<br/><br/></p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p>SAVE offers lower monthly payments than other IDR plans, the <a href=\"https://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org/save-a-new-payment-plan-that-will-reduce-monthly-payments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NCLC</a> says. But IDR plans do not offer the lowest monthly payment for every borrower, or save every borrower the most money long-term.</p><p>In an IDR plan, you\u2019re generally billed a percentage of your discretionary income \u2014 that\u2019s the difference between your income and an amount the Department of Education determines you need to meet your basic needs, the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a> says. That amount is normally 150% of the federal poverty line, but it\u2019s <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">225% of the federal poverty line for SAVE</a>. In other words, SAVE\u2019s formula lets participants keep more of their paycheck for non-loan expenses.\u00a0</p><p>If your income is lower, an IDR plan requires you to pay less each month. And if your income is below that discretionary income threshold, you pay nothing. For example, a single person making $32,800 annually will not be required to make monthly payments on their student debt if they\u2019re on the SAVE plan.</p><p>But because IDR plans like SAVE bill you based on your income instead of how much you owe, people with higher incomes are charged higher bills. These bills are sometimes higher than those for the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standard repayment plan</a>, which calculates your installments based on a 10-year repayment window.</p><p>Additionally, as long as you make your monthly payments on a SAVE plan, interest won\u2019t be added to your loans. That could make SAVE more affordable over time if you\u2019re unable to pay off your monthly interest otherwise.\u00a0</p><p>Whether SAVE reduces how much you pay over the lifetime of your loan depends on how much you make, how big your loans are and the interest rate of those loans. You can speak with a financial advisor, a student borrower advocacy organization or use the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/loan-simulator/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid loan repayment calculator</a> to help you determine which repayment plan saves you the most money in the long run.</p><p>Only some benefits offered by SAVE plans are available to borrowers right now. The remaining benefits will become available in July 2024.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a>, SAVE currently:</p><p>In July 2024, SAVE will also:</p><p><strong class=\"cms__embed-related-story\">RELATED: <a class=\"cms__embed-related-story__link\" href=\"/article/news/verify/student-loan/student-loans-discharged-bankruptcy-court-undue-hardship-adversary-proceeding/536-5cf3050b-6a22-4956-9ea3-10346802b15b\">Yes, your student loans can be discharged in bankruptcy, but it\u2019s not guaranteed</a></strong></p><p><strong class=\"cms__embed-related-story\">RELATED: <a class=\"cms__embed-related-story__link\" href=\"/article/news/verify/student-loan/supreme-court-blocks-student-loan-forgiveness-what-borrowers-need-to-know/536-100f6540-56e7-4050-9f04-07f4345ad732\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">What the SCOTUS student loan forgiveness decisions means for borrowers: VERIFY Fact Sheet</a></strong></p><p class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__left-message\">The <a class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link_bold_true\" href=\"https://www.verifythis.com/?utm_source=desktop_article_embed\" target=\"_blank\">VERIFY</a> team works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

The jet stream constantly shifts. Recently, it's been sitting far north enough to mean that warm air has been blasting the normally frigid Upper Midwest.</p><p>\u201cThe orientation of it right now is not very winter-like,\u201d said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.</p><p>In all weather science, it\u2019s virtually impossible to directly attribute any individual phenomenon to a specific cause. How global warming affects the position of the jet stream is a case in point.</p><p>But climate change, caused by human activities that release plant-warming gasses like carbon dioxide, is causing global temperatures to be warmer than normal. In fact, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/record-hot-no-snow-climate-change-ff0f384d60bb4229d720fc73c602e502\">January 2024 broke the record for the warmest first month of the year</a>, which was previously set in 2020, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service of the European Space Agency. January was 2.74 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Also at play is a weather pattern called El Ni\u00f1o, which can cause the jet stream to sit more northward than usual.</p><p>The East Coast will see warmer weather arrive by mid-week, with cities like Washington and New York expecting temperatures well above normal.</p><p>Southern regions are also experiencing unusually warm weather, and could see temperatures in the \u201880s and \u201990s. Dallas-Fort Worth is likely to be at least in the low '90s, which would break a daily record.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press\u2019 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

In response, the store chain issued a recall that impacted more than 400 of their stores in the southern United States.</p><p>More than 230 employees who worked for the facility were impacted by the infestation, said West Memphis Mayor Marco McClendon.</p><p>A criminal information that was unsealed in a Little Rock federal court on Monday charged Family Dollar with a misdemeanor count of \"causing FDA-regulated products to become adulterated while being held under insanitary conditions.\"</p><p>The company, (which is a subsidiary of Dollar Tree Inc.,) entered a plea agreement and must now pay a fine of $41.675 million. This fine is the largest-ever monetary criminal penalty involving a food safety case.</p><p>As part of the agreement, both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree must now meet \"robust corporate compliance and reporting\" requirements for the duration of the next three years.</p><p>\u201cConsumers trust that products purchased from retail stores such as Family Dollar are safe,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Ross for the Eastern District of Arkansas. \u201cIt is incomprehensible that Family Dollar knew about the rodent and pest issues at its distribution center in Arkansas but continued to ship products that were unsafe and insanitary. Knowingly selling these types of products not only places the public\u2019s health at risk but erodes the trust consumers have in the products they purchase. Products shipped and sold are required to be safe for consumers and the safety of Arkansans and others are extremely important to this office. Let me be clear, if you conduct business in Arkansas and allow the shipment or sale of unsafe and insanitary products, you will be held accountable.\u201d</p><p>During their guilty plea, the company said that their distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas shipped FDA-regulated products to over 400 stores in the states of Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.</p><p>They went on to explain that the company first got reports of both mouse and pet issues with deliveries being made to stores in August 2020. By the end of that year, several stores reported having received both rodents and products damaged by rodents from their warehouse.\u00a0</p><p>They also admitted that they continued to ship those products from their warehouse until January 2022 when an inspection done by the FDA showed that there were live, dead, and decaying rodents as well as rodent feces, urine, orders and so much more throughout the facility.</p><p>Fumigation that was later done showed that more than 1,200 rodents were exterminated inside the warehouse.</p><p>In February 2022, the company then made the decision to recall all the drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and both human and animal food products that were sold in their over 400 stores since January 2021.</p>",

Lawmakers are hoping to move this bill as soon as possible.</p><p>The IRS said it is \"closely monitoring\" the legislation but reminds taxpayers not to wait to file their 2023 tax returns.

During peak hours, or at locations where the apps are used frequently \u2014 such as airports \u2014 prices will increase for customers trying to get a ride.\u00a0</p><p>Tanner also revealed that Wendy's was using its own internal AI model - named \"Frosty\" - in several restaurants. While he didn't specify what exactly the AI was doing, he told investors that the company was seeing \"ongoing improvement in speed and accuracy\" at those locations.\u00a0</p><p>In a statement, the company confirmed its plans to test dynamic pricing on menu items as well as move to digital menu boards.\u00a0</p><p>\"As we\u2019ve previously shared, we are making a significant investment in technology to accelerate our digital business. In addition to evolving our loyalty program, one of the other benefits of these investments will be the flexibility to change the menu more easily and to offer discounts and value offers to our customers through innovations such as digital menuboards, which will roll out in some U.S. restaurants,\" the company stated.\u00a0</p><p>\"Wendy\u2019s has always been about providing high quality food at a great value to our customers and this recent investment will continue that by driving traffic and providing value during slower parts of the day. As early as 2025, we plan to test a number of features such as AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as weather that we think will provide great value and an improved customer and crew experience,\" Wendy's added.\u00a0</p><p>It's unclear whether the dynamic pricing model would allow costs to dip below the current, static prices if demand was low at a particular time, or if there would be a floor. It's also unclear if there would be a cap on the surge pricing for food items (ride-hailing apps tend to not have a cap).</p>",

Wheezing is not normal, so if you wheeze, someone should be evaluating you.\"</p><p>While the medications can help with hay fever, runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes, now is a good time to start using some of them.</p><p>It's important to remember the cold and flu season isn't over, so be aware those sneezes and sniffles could be related to a virus. Allergies usually come with itchy and watery eyes, ears, and throat, as well as wheezing and long-lasting symptoms. Cold or flu can include fever, chills, sore throat, and body aches.</p><p>Experts say you shouldn't use nasal steroid sprays for colds or flu. Hong also advises caution when using nasal decongestants too.\u00a0</p><p>\"We as allergists and physicians really don't love our patients using any of the nasal decongestants, and the reason for it is that if they use these medications for more than three to five days, the nose can get addicted to those medications,\" she said. \"They don't get addicted to nasal steroids or antihistamines, but the nasal decongestants can be very, very addictive, so that when they stop using it, they get super stuffy more than even when they started.\"</p><p>Additionally, Hone just attended the annual American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology conference in Washington, D.C., where Cleveland Clinic presented findings from nine years of research into potentially curing young children of food allergies.</p><p>Any parent of a child who has a severe food allergy often lives in fear of exposure and the nightmare of an anaphylactic reaction. <a href=\"https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2023/08/03/cleveland-clinic-researchers-confirm-early-intervention-curbs-peanut-allergies-in-babies/\">Cleveland Clinic has been testing immunotherapy on children under the age of 4</a>, and the research indicates if the child gets early intervention before age 4, there's a possibility the allergy can be cured. Intervention includes giving miniscule amounts of the food the child is allergic to to help build tolerance. \u00a0</p><p>\"Once they get to 4 years and above, typically the patient will live with that allergy lifelong, and they'll be therapies like immunotherapy out there,\" Hong, who also serves as the Clinic's medical director for the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/respiratory/depts/food-allergies\" id=\"isPasted\">Food Allergy Center of Excellence</a>, stated. \"However, the problem is they live with it as opposed to the possibility of a cure, and we're getting 80 to 90% improvement. We're one of the only academic centers in the country that are doing this therapy, and we've been doing it for about nine years now.</p><p>\"Our studies are actually showing improvement and patients do amazingly well. We have patients coming to us from the tri-state area from all over the country for this therapy because there's not many people doing it out there.</p><p>So how does a parent know if their child has a food allergy?</p><p>\"Very frequently, there are the highly allergenic foods, such as peanut, egg, milk, wheat, soy, tree nuts, and seafood and shellfish,\" Hong said. \"So when these foods are introduced to the diet, if they notice symptoms and very frequently in the really young ones below the age of 2, it's actually rashes, they'll have hives, or they'll vomit for you.\"</p><p>Hong advises anyone who has an allergic reaction to any food or environmental substance to talk to an allergist and consider getting a skin test. Treatments can vary from allergy shots to sublingual immunotherapy, which is a small pill placed under the tongue for those who prefer to avoid shots.</p><p>Other research out of the annual conference included the findings of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-medication-help-reduce-allergic-reactions-multiple-foods-after-accidental\">Xolair</a>, an allergic asthma medication first approved in 2003.\u00a0</p><p>In 2017 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a study of 177 kids, aged 1 to 17, who were allergic to peanuts and two more foods, such as tree nuts, milk, eggs, or wheat. The study was published in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, and the drug is now available to anyone aged 1 and older. But Hong says not everyone will qualify for the drug, and they must be aware of the side effects.</p><p>\"Ironically, people can have allergic reactions to Xolair,\" she added. \"We need to make sure that patients are monitored, to make sure that they can tolerate the medication without allergic reactions. There are also black box warnings on it that include an increased risk [of] cerebrovascular issues like heart attacks, TIAs like transient ischemic attacks, and blood clots. But that being said, I think an allergist would be able to work through, like, who would be an amazing candidate for this medication.\"</p>",

The person who notes the license plate of a car leaving the scene of a shooting, the passerby that steps in to stop an assault, or the customer who stops a robbery are not considered vigilantes, even when they may detain a suspect until the police arrive.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhile law enforcement discourages such activity, especially when the citizen could be endangered, it does not ignore the information that is provided by the citizen who intervenes,\u201d he continued.</p><p>The responses come roughly two weeks after a group of defense attorneys filed petitions imploring the high court to use its \u201cKing\u2019s Bench\u201d powers to decide the legality of using evidence gathered by Harris and others like him.</p><p>The attorneys represent people criminally charged after they were caught in online child sex stings orchestrated by citizens, not the police. They are attorneys William Abraham and Ellen Granahan, on behalf of Rodney Albertson; attorney William Watt, on behalf of Zachary Mitchell; and attorney Joseph Sklarosky, on behalf of John Davenport.</p><p>Harris, who says he\u2019s exposed more than 620 people since 2020, poses as a child online and agrees to meet with grown men he chats with for the purpose of sex. When Harris arrives at the meet up, he goes live on social media and exposes the alleged would-be abuser.</p><p>Information he provided to law enforcement as a \u201cconfidential witness\u201d pushed prosecutions forward on several cases.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThese are not the acts of a vigilante,\u201d McMonagle wrote. \u201cInstead, they are the acts of a person who, while being advised against this activity, is doing what he can to assist police in safeguarding the well-being of children in Luzerne County.\u201d</p><p>The attorneys representing some of those criminally charged are seeking the high court\u2019s intervention to prevent \u201cirreparable harm.\u201d The defense attorneys argue the statutes under which their clients are charged only empower law enforcement officers to act in undercover stings.</p><p>Proposed legislation that would amend the unlawful contact with a minor statute and allow anyone to pose as a minor never moved out of the House judiciary committee. Lawmakers \u201cexpressed a clear legislative intent\u201d to narrow the scope of those authorized to investigate, the defense attorneys argued.</p><p>In this week\u2019s responses, the district attorney\u2019s office pushed back by arguing the issue is not sufficiently important to warrant immediate intervention by the courts through use of \u201cKing\u2019s Bench\u201d powers.</p><p>Those powers, based on English common law, allow the high court to weigh in on cases pending in lower courts \u2014 or even on matters that are not in the judicial system \u2014 when need arises to address issues of \u201cimmediate public importance,\u201d according to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.</p><p>The state Supreme Court rarely exercises such a power. When it has, it did so to settle issues involving election disputes, public employee strikes, prison overcrowding, judicial misconduct and legislative powers, according to the AOPC.</p><p>\u201cPredator catcher\u201d assistance to police does not fit the bill, county prosecutors said.</p><p>\u201cIt (King\u2019s Bench power) is not meant to be used as a vehicle to bypass the normal adjudicative process,\u201d McMonagle wrote. \u201cPetitioner's efforts to have his case dismissed has been denied at every turn. He can make these arguments in the normal process of the criminal justice system. If he is convicted, he may raise these issues on appeal.\"</p><p>\"He should not be able to bypass this process by requesting this Honorable Court to exercise a power that is to be used cautiously.\u201d</p>",

Most recently, on Feb. 21, 2024, the administration announced it has <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-12-billion-loan-forgiveness-over-150000-save-plan-borrowers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forgiven $138 billion in student loans for 3.9 million borrowers</a> since President Joe Biden first entered office.</p><p>VERIFY reader Diane emailed us to ask if borrowers receiving forgiveness are getting checks, and if borrowers have to use that money on their student loans if they do receive checks.</p><p>Does the federal government send checks for student loan forgiveness?</p><p>No, the federal government does not send checks for student loan forgiveness.</p><p>When the U.S. Department of Education forgives someone\u2019s federal student loan, it simply erases the remaining repayment balance on that loan. It does not issue checks for forgiveness.\u00a0</p><p>When the government forgives a borrower\u2019s student loan debt, it rids the borrower of their obligation to repay all or a portion of their loan, the Education Department\u2019s <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/difference-between-loan-forgiveness-cancellation-and-discharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid</a> website says.</p><p>If the government forgives the full amount of your loan, you won\u2019t have to make any more payments on that loan, <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation#frequently-asked-questions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid</a> says. If only a part of your loan has been forgiven, \u00a0the amount you have to pay will be reduced and you\u2019ll still need to pay the remaining balance.</p><p>Or as <a href=\"https://www.debt.org/students/loan-forgiveness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Debt.org</a>, a debt information resource, puts it: \u201cForgiveness means all or part of your student loan is wiped away. Poof!\u201d\u00a0</p><p>There are a couple instances where borrowers could receive checks from the Education Department, but those are for overpayment refunds or loan cancellations.\u00a0</p><p>One instance is if the Education Department completely cancels a borrower\u2019s student loan that they have already partially or fully paid off, the <a href=\"https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/loan-cancellation-forgiveness-bankruptcy/cancellation-forgiveness-options/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Consumer Law Center (NCLC)</a> says.</p><p>This could happen for a borrower who is granted a closed school discharge, the <a href=\"https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/loan-cancellation-forgiveness-bankruptcy/cancellation-forgiveness-options/closed-school/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NCLC</a> says. When the Education Department grants this kind of discharge, it cancels the loans the person borrowed to attend the closed school, gives the borrower a refund of payments made on those loans and deletes any negative credit history associated with those loans from the borrower\u2019s credit report.</p><p>The Department of Education may also send refunds to borrowers who have overpaid on student loan debt that has been forgiven. For example, borrowers in the Department of Education\u2019s income-driven repayment program have received refunds for payments made long after they were eligible for forgiveness.</p><p class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__left-message\">The <a class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link_bold_true\" href=\"https://www.verifythis.com/?utm_source=desktop_article_embed\" target=\"_blank\">VERIFY</a> team works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

It arrived today.\u201d</p><p>The senator had been under increasing pressure from the restive, and at times hostile wing of his party that has aligned firmly with Trump.\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-trump-fed-lies-to-mob-36871d68df56a10be1c46ed364ad6de6\">The two have been estranged</a> since\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-gop-electoral-college-34fb478601b72b3e8049f12371670001\">December 2020</a>, when McConnell refused to abide Trump\u2019s lie that the election of Democrat Joe Biden as president was the product of fraud.</p><p>But while McConnell's critics within the GOP conference had grown louder, their numbers had not grown appreciably larger, a marker of McConnell\u2019s strategic and tactical skill and his ability to understand the needs of his fellow Republican senators.</p><p>McConnell gave no specific reason for the timing of his decision, which he has been contemplating for months, but he cited the recent death of his wife's youngest sister as a moment that prompted introspection. \u201cThe end of my contributions are closer than I\u2019d prefer,\u201d McConnell said.</p><p>But his remarks were also light at times as he talked about the arc of his Senate career.</p><p>He noted that when he arrived in the Senate, \u201cI was just happy if anybody remembered my name.\u201d During his campaign in 1984, when Reagan was visiting Kentucky, the president called him \u201cMitch O\u2019Donnell.\u201d</p><p>McConnell endorsed Reagan\u2019s view of America\u2019s role in the world and the senator has persisted in face of opposition, including from Trump, that Congress should include a foreign assistance package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine.</p><p>\u201cI am unconflicted about the good within our country and the irreplaceable role we play as the leader of the free world,\" McConnell said.</p><p>Against long odds he managed to secure 22 Republican votes for the package now being considered by the House.</p><p>\u201cBelieve me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them,\" McConnell said. \"That said, I believe more strongly than ever that America\u2019s global leadership is essential to preserving the shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan discussed. For as long as I am drawing breath on this earth I will defend American exceptionalism.\u201d</p><p>Trump has pulled the party hard to the ideological right, questioning longtime military alliances such as NATO, international trade agreements and pushing for a severe crackdown on immigration, all the while clinging to the falsehood that the election was stolen from him in 2020.</p><p>McConnell and Trump had worked together in Trump\u2019s first term, remaking the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary in a far more conservative image, and on tax legislation. But there was also friction from the start, with Trump frequently sniping at the senator.</p><p>Their relationship has essentially been over since Trump refused to accept the results of the Electoral College. But the rupture deepened dramatically after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. McConnell assigned blame and responsibility to Trump and said that he should be held to account through the criminal justice system for his actions.</p><p>McConnell\u2019s critics insist he could have done more, including voting to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial.\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-impeachments-trump-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-0a14d2e41e376331580b98a992f7d856#:~:text=Mitch%20McConnell%20delivered%20a%20scalding,face%20trial%20in%20the%20Senate.\">McConnell did not</a>, arguing that since Trump was no longer in office, he could not be subject to impeachment.</p><p>Rather than fade from prominence after the Capitol riot, Trump continued to assert his control over the party, and finds himself on a clear glidepath to the Republican nomination. Other members of the Republican Senate leadership have endorsed Trump. McConnell has not, and that has drawn criticism from other Republican senators.</p><p>McConnell\u2019s path to power was hardly linear, but from the day he walked onto the Senate floor in 1985 and took his seat as the most junior Republican senator, he set his sights on being the party leader. What set him apart was that so many other Senate leaders wanted to run for president. McConnell wanted to run the Senate. He lost races for lower party positions before steadily ascending, and finally became party leader in 2006 and has won nine straight elections.</p><p>He most recently\u00a0<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-mitch-mcconnell-congress-9f1be1d3635127dbb3e17a3fae1ac86d\">beat back a challenge</a> led by Sen. Rick Scott of Florida last November.</p><p>McConnell built his power base by a combination of care and nurturing of his members, including understanding their political imperatives. After seeing the potential peril of a rising Tea Party, he also established a super political action committee, The Senate Leadership Fund, which has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Republican candidates.</p><p>Despite the concerns about his health, colleagues have said in recent months that they believe he has recovered. McConnell was not impaired cognitively, but did have some additional physical limitations.</p><p>\u201cI love the Senate,\u201d he said in his prepared remarks. \u201cIt has been my life. There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt there are any with more admiration for it.\u201d</p><p>But, he added, \"Father Time remains undefeated. I am no longer the young man sitting in the back, hoping colleagues would remember my name. It is time for the next generation of leadership.\u201d</p><p>There would be a time to reminisce, he said, but not today.</p><p>\u201cI still have enough gas in the tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm which they have become accustomed.\u201d</p>",

On X, formerly Twitter, more than 860,000 posts about Wendy's were circulating, with users largely annoyed by how the perceived change could impact fast food prices.\u00a0</p><p>In the initial call with investors on Feb. 15, Tanner said the company would spend around $20 million over the next two years to establish digital menu boards that will allow restaurants to change prices on the fly.\u00a0</p><p>Tanner also revealed that Wendy's was using its own internal AI model - named \"Frosty\" - in several restaurants.

We have called him an artist, but when I was dealing with the people at the museum, they have distinct classifications of people. And they consider my father a craftsman,\" said Juanita Patience-Moss, the daughter of C. Edgar Patience.</p><p>Now in her 90s, Juanita Patience-Moss remains a proponent of her father's work. His sculptures, busts, souvenirs, and jewelry are all made from anthracite coal. Much of the art was made by Patience in his workshop in West Pittston.</p><p>\"The dust would be so thick it would be like fog. I'd open the door and call 'Daddy!' I never went in there. And that's what killed him; all that coal dust destroyed his lungs.\"</p><p>Patience died in 1972, but his work is still studied by historians and art enthusiasts.</p><p>\"This is the first item that you see in the Anthracite Heritage Museum because we use this to actually talk about the properties of anthracite coal,\" said John Fielding, the museum's curator.</p><p>Some of his art demonstrates how anthracite\u2014an energy source and art medium\u2014is mined, something Fielding says is not an easy thing to do.</p><p>\"Anthracite coal, it's not really stable, so it's very hard to work with.

And the idea was to fight for freedom for his people. And that's why he did it. so, there's perseverance right there,\" Patience-Moss said.</p><p>Patience then demonstrated perseverance with his work, setting an example for his children.</p><p>\"He loved what he did, no doubt about that. He never did anything else his whole life. He was always working with his father. When his father passed away, he continued to work.\"</p><p>Patience-Moss says that perseverance was then passed on to her.</p><p>\"Perhaps it's genetic. Who knows? I don't know. Yes, I had a lot of perseverance because I went back to college after being out for two years, many years, 44 years, and I went back to Wilkes College, and I was probably the only married woman in the class at that time in 1958.\"</p><p>Perseverance is what Patience-Moss says she wants her father to be remembered for the most. And we don't have to travel far to see examples of the perseverance of C. Edgar Patience in Scranton.</p><p>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>",

A study out of Florida showed that Black babies had a 50% higher chance of death if they had a white pediatrician.<strong>\u00a0</strong>So there are significant deficits and delinquencies, or whatever titles or names you want to put with it, when it comes to care for Black women and people of color in general.\u201d</p><p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020496/\">why these disparities exist</a>, Owens Robinson said access to care is too simple an answer.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's because of lack of income, lack of jobs, lack of employment, lack of insurance, racism \u2013 institutional, systemic in the health care system,\" she said. \"It's lack of generational wealth, it's lack of food, it's food deserts, maternal deserts, the list goes on.\"</p><p>Owens Robinson said <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/\">racism plays a clear factor in the care Black women receive</a>, even now.</p><p>\"They did a study before COVID, a survey of white med students. And they still think we have thicker skin and don't need as much pain medicine. And that was this decade,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Having these massive disparities isn't just frustrating, it can be deadly.</p><p>\"Frustrating puts it -- I think that makes it mild,\" Owens Robinson said. \"People want to say it's access and people want to say it's poor. But Dr. Shalon Irving worked for the CDC epidemiology department, she had two Ph.D.s, two master's degrees and was fighting this same subject. And 15 days after delivery died.\"</p><p>She said having a provider who looks like you and understands you makes a big impact.</p><p>\"Studies have shown that our Black babies survive better, we listen better, we do better when the providers in front of us have similar cultural backgrounds and respect for where we're coming from,\" Owens Robinson said.\u00a0</p><p>She's seen the difference it makes firsthand.</p><p>\"And when you walk into a room, even with a mask on, you could see their face light up. You could see their shoulders drop down. You could see them smiling beneath the mask, because they're like 'oh, this doctor looks like me,'\" she said. \"So I think it's just a level of comfort and trust.\"</p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/21/health/black-doctors-shortage-us/index.html\">CNN reports</a> less than 6% of physicians in the U.S. are Black.</p><p>Owens Robinson said she knew she wanted to be a physician at just 5 years old. Counselors tried in middle school and high school to deter her, steering her toward teaching. She said graduating from medical school with her family cheering her on, and now serving women, means so much.\u00a0</p><p>\"I think it's even more meaningful 23 years later. I tell patients sometimes I cry at deliveries, and I tell fathers, this is a miracle. I'm involved in the miracle of life every day. So I'm blessed,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>That drive to help others is now what helps her advocate for a more equitable health care system. She knows solutions won't be simple or fast, but it's a path forward that needs to begin.\u00a0</p><p>\"And I think that's where it starts. I think we need to look at ourselves and see where we can do better,\" Owens Robinson said.\u00a0</p><p>As for what can be done to improve these disparities, Owens Robinson said implicit bias training in health care should be mandatory. And when it comes to preventing a disease, illness or cancer, she said education is key.\u00a0</p><p>For OBGYNs, she said having midwives and doulas in the delivery rooms can make a massive difference in creating positive outcomes for both mom and baby. And for the doctors themselves, listening to their patients and really hearing what they say is critical.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cAnd then, the bigger problems are dealing with institutional, systemic racism. And my colleague asked, 'Well how do we fix that?' I said that started 400 years ago when our toes touched the soil. We\u2019re not going to fix it in 400 days,\" Owens Robinson said. \"It\u2019s a generational, systemic institutional broken system and it\u2019s going to take multiple tears and years and people to get involved and to care to make a difference.\"</p><p><span id=\"isPasted\" lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>SUGGESTED VIDEOS:\u00a0</strong></span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlV2Iuo79CupkSY4k2yYaNeC9EBXhNCjI\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Telling Black Stories</strong></span></a></p>",

Authorities publicly named Washington as a suspect in 2007. He told Playboy magazine in 2003 he\u2019d been outside the studio, heard the shots and saw \u201cLittle D\u201d \u2014 one of Jordan\u2019s monikers \u2014 racing out of the building.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/music-general-news-331470f3c4d442abb214f7e86ee760d2\">Relatives of Mizell</a> welcomed the verdict and lamented that his mother did not live to see it.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I was carrying a 2,000-pound weight on my shoulders.
