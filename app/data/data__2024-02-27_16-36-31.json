The earlier cancer is caught, the greater the chance is for a better outcome.

That age is typically 40.</p><p>For prostate cancer, discussions usually start around the age of 50.</p><p>\"Whether or not it would be a good idea to simply do an examination or combine that with a blood test called a PSA, which sometimes can be helpful in guiding the next step to determine if a cancer diagnosis exists.\"</p><p>Dr. Pandya says an increasing number of patients are being diagnosed with colon cancer, particularly in people under the age of 40.</p><p>\"The first thing to ask is, 'Do you have any family members that have been diagnosed with colon cancer?'

            "article_content": "<p>ARKANSAS, USA — On Monday, Family Dollar Stores LLC pleaded guilty to having stored food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics in unsanitary conditions inside its almost 30-year-old warehouse in <a href=\"/article/news/local/west-memphis-arkansas-family-dollar-warehouse-rat-infestation/522-342ee73e-804a-4030-a7c9-b04315074a53\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">West Memphis</a>. </p><p>In February 2022, the FDA announced that there were about 1,000 rats found inside the facility. In response, the store chain issued a recall that impacted more than 400 of their stores in the southern United States.</p><p>More than 230 employees who worked for the facility were impacted by the infestation, said West Memphis Mayor Marco McClendon.</p><p>A criminal information that was unsealed in a Little Rock federal court on Monday charged Family Dollar with a misdemeanor count of \"causing FDA-regulated products to become adulterated while being held under insanitary conditions.\"</p><p>The company, (which is a subsidiary of Dollar Tree Inc.,) entered a plea agreement and must now pay a fine of $41.675 million. This fine is the largest-ever monetary criminal penalty involving a food safety case.</p><p>As part of the agreement, both Family Dollar and Dollar Tree must now meet \"robust corporate compliance and reporting\" requirements for the duration of the next three years.</p><p>“Consumers trust that products purchased from retail stores such as Family Dollar are safe,” said U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Ross for the Eastern District of Arkansas. “It is incomprehensible that Family Dollar knew about the rodent and pest issues at its distribution center in Arkansas but continued to ship products that were unsafe and insanitary. Knowingly selling these types of products not only places the public’s health at risk but erodes the trust consumers have in the products they purchase. Products shipped and sold are required to be safe for consumers and the safety of Arkansans and others are extremely important to this office. Let me be clear, if you conduct business in Arkansas and allow the shipment or sale of unsafe and insanitary products, you will be held accountable.”</p><p>During their guilty plea, the company said that their distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas shipped FDA-regulated products to over 400 stores in the states of Alabama, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.</p><p>They went on to explain that the company first got reports of both mouse and pet issues with deliveries being made to stores in August 2020. By the end of that year, several stores reported having received both rodents and products damaged by rodents from their warehouse. </p><p>They also admitted that they continued to ship those products from their warehouse until January 2022 when an inspection done by the FDA showed that there were live, dead, and decaying rodents as well as rodent feces, urine, orders and so much more throughout the facility.</p><p>Fumigation that was later done showed that more than 1,200 rodents were exterminated inside the warehouse.</p><p>In February 2022, the company then made the decision to recall all the drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and both human and animal food products that were sold in their over 400 stores since January 2021.</p>"

Negotiators from the United States, Egypt and Qatar have been working to broker a cease-fire that would see Hamas free some of the dozens of hostages it holds in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners, a six-week halt in fighting and an increase in aid deliveries to Gaza.</p><p>The start of Ramadan, which is expected to be around March 10, is seen as an unofficial deadline for a deal. The month is a time of heightened religious observance and dawn-to-dusk fasting for hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-violence-jerusalem-explainer-1a269c8cc748d8e6f5eb9eabb6d9b860\">Israeli-Palestinian tensions</a> have flared in the past during the holy month.</p><p>“Ramadan’s coming up, and there has been an agreement by the Israelis that they would not engage in activities during Ramadan as well, in order to give us time to get all the hostages out,” Biden said in an appearance <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/biden-seth-meyers-donors-2024-3ba258c294d0697f2f2963f3025dd529\">on NBC’s “Late Night With Seth Meyers”</a> that was recorded Monday.</p><p>In separate comments the same day, Biden said that he <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-news-02-26-2024-8682b5446e285a7fc641c9f869df9348\">hoped a cease-fire deal</a> could take effect by next week.</p><p>At the same time, Biden did not call for an end to the war, which was triggered when Hamas militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted roughly 250 people, according to Israeli authorities.</p><p>Israeli officials said Biden’s comments came as a surprise and were not made in coordination with the country’s leadership. A Hamas official played down any sense of progress, saying the group wouldn’t soften its demands.</p><p>The Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the sensitive talks with the media, said Israel wants a deal immediately, but that Hamas continues to push excessive demands. They also said that Israel is insisting that female soldiers be part of the first group of hostages released under any truce deal.</p><p>Hamas official Ahmad Abdel-Hadi indicated that optimism on a deal was premature.</p><p>“The resistance is not interested in giving up any of its demands, and what is proposed does not meet what it had requested,” he told the Pan-Arab TV channel Al Mayadeen.</p><p>Hamas has previously demanded that Israel end the war as part of any deal, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called “delusional.”</p><p>At a news conference Tuesday in Doha, Qatar Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said “we feel optimistic” about the talks, without elaborating.</p><p>A senior official from Egypt has said the draft deal includes the release of up to 40 women and older hostages in return for up to 300 Palestinian prisoners — mostly women, minors and older people.</p><p>The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations, said the proposed six-week pause in fighting would allow hundreds of trucks to bring <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-humanitarian-aid-gaza-1ce556a8a839803c8a1624b1b69b0a13\">desperately needed aid</a> into Gaza every day, including to the hard-hit north.</p><p>Biden, who has shown staunch support for Israel throughout the war, left open the door in his remarks for an eventual Israeli ground offensive in the city of <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/gaza-rafah-israel-hamas-war-photo-gallery-2a93ded7d44b9720d941f7e53c5bf45e\">Rafah in southern Gaza</a>, on the border with Egypt, where more than half of the enclave's 2.3 million people have fled under Israeli evacuation orders.</p><p>Netanyahu has said a ground operation in Rafah is an inevitable component of Israel’s strategy for crushing Hamas. This week, the military submitted for Cabinet approval operational plans for the offensive, as well as evacuation plans for civilians there.</p><p>Biden said he believes Israel has slowed its bombardment of Rafah.</p><p>“They have to, and they have made a commitment to me that they’re going to see to it that there’s an ability to evacuate significant portions of Rafah before they go and take out the remainder of Hamas,\" he said. “But it’s a process.”</p><p>Israel's offensive in Gaza has killed more than 29,700 people, most of them women and children, according to the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-health-ministry-health-death-toll-59470820308b31f1faf73c703400b033\">Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza</a>.

During peak hours, or at locations where the apps are used frequently — such as airports — prices will increase for customers trying to get a ride. </p><p>Tanner also revealed that Wendy's was using its own internal AI model - named \"Frosty\" - in several restaurants. While he didn't specify what exactly the AI was doing, he told investors that the company was seeing \"ongoing improvement in speed and accuracy\" at those locations. </p><p>In a statement, the company confirmed its plans to test dynamic pricing on menu items as well as move to digital menu boards. </p><p>\"As we’ve previously shared, we are making a significant investment in technology to accelerate our digital business. In addition to evolving our loyalty program, one of the other benefits of these investments will be the flexibility to change the menu more easily and to offer discounts and value offers to our customers through innovations such as digital menuboards, which will roll out in some U.S. restaurants,\" the company stated. </p><p>\"Wendy’s has always been about providing high quality food at a great value to our customers and this recent investment will continue that by driving traffic and providing value during slower parts of the day. As early as 2025, we plan to test a number of features such as AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as weather that we think will provide great value and an improved customer and crew experience,\" Wendy's added. </p><p>It's unclear whether the dynamic pricing model would allow costs to dip below the current, static prices if demand was low at a particular time, or if there would be a floor. It's also unclear if there would be a cap on the surge pricing for food items (ride-hailing apps tend to not have a cap).</p>"

At the same time, the company signaled a pivot to luxury, which has fared better overall. It said it would open 15 of its higher end Bloomingdale’s stores and 30 of its luxury Blue Mercury cosmetics locations.</p><p>The Macy's stores set to close account for less than 10% of its sales, the company said.</p><p>While adjusted net income and revenue topped Wall Street expectations, Macy's offered a muted outlook for the year.</p><p>“We are making the necessary moves to reinvigorate relationships with our customers through improved shopping experiences, relevant assortments and compelling value,” said Macy’s CEO <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/macys-ceo-gennette-spring-retail-department-store-ef6f5ece8f082507ffff720736cae95a\">Tony Spring</a> who succeeded Jeff Gennette last month.</p><p>Shares of Macy's ralllied about 7% in morning trading.</p><p>The plans come as the department store chain faces a proxy fight from <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/macys-arkhouse-brigade-takeover-proxy-4cc435a513e00f524e9d4796fd105a87\">Arkhouse Management</a> which nominated a slate of nine director for election to Macy's board last week. Last month, Macy's rejected a $5.8 billion <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/macys-arkhouse-brigade-takeover-c9167d79c3fe39a192a0ac4c80341408\">takeover offer</a> from the hedge fund and Brigade Capital Management, an investment manager.</p><p>Activist investors and pressure to increase sales are just two critical issues facing the new CEO.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, department stores were facing intense competition from online rivals. Neiman Marcus, JCPenney and Bed Bath &amp; Beyond all filed for bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Consumers have proven resilient and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/economy-growth-inflation-gdp-consumers-spending-rates-e21bb23cebe6d2ae10b0f0e9876691fd\">willing to shop</a> even after a bout of inflation, though behaviors have shifted, with some Americans <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/retail-sales-inflation-commerce-department-consumers-8dc9a9f1dd6745cef23e75948069446a\">trading down</a> to lower priced goods.</p><p>Spring told analysts that while inflation has slowed, so has labor and wage growth.</p><p>“As such, we expect our consumer to remain under pressure, ” Spring said.</p><p>Macy’s is maneuvering to shore up sales by accelerating the expansion of small-format stores that can provide more convenience to its customers. It announced plans in October to add up to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/macys-smallformat-stores-retail-8e2c4fc2ea5a66e3ebd6ff4b83d93667\">30 small-format locations</a> through the fall of 2025, bringing the total number to roughly 42. The next round of expansion starts in the fall.</p><p>Yet Macy's is still cutting jobs to lower costs. In January, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/wayfair-job-cuts-retail-layoffs-c738ec2c836686e9d60cf7491ab4eaeb\">Macy's</a> said it would trim about 3.5% of its total workforce, roughly 2,350 employees, and close five locations.</p><p>Arkhouse and Brigade offered $21 for each of the remaining shares in Macy’s they don’t already own. Macy’s said it had had concerns about the financing plan and the value of the offer.</p><p>Last week, Macy said that it was seeking additional financing information from Arkhouse and Brigade to potentially advance talks with its board. Rather than providing that additional information, Macy’s said Arkhouse sought to extend its director nomination window by 10 days.</p><p>Spring told analysts the retailer still believes in its physical footprint.</p><p>“We believe in stores,” he said. “We have to focus on making sure that we have the best stores, not the largest number of stores.\"</p><p>The strategy comes after Macy's surveyed 60,000 customers about what they liked and disliked about the shopping experience. What they found was that customers wanted less cluttered stores and more service. Macy's also is overhauling its private brands, which help stores stand out and also have better profit margins.</p><p>Macy's had a quarterly loss of $71 million, or 26 cents per share. Adjusted for impairment and restructuringcharges, Macy's earned $2.45 per share, topping Wall Street projections for $1.98, according to FactSet.</p><p>That compares with a profit of $508 million last year in the same period.</p><p>Sales fell nearly 2% to $8.12 billion but still better than the $8.09 billion that industry analysts had expected.</p><p>Online sales decreased 4% while sales at stores were roughly flat.</p><p>Overall, comparable sales, which included sales at stores and its digital channels opened at least a year, slipped 5.4%.</p><p>At its namesake stores, sales at stores opened at least a year fell 6% including its licensed business during the latest quarter, while the metric at Bloomingdale's was down 1.5%.</p><p>The company expects profit for the current fiscal year in the range of $2.45 to $2.85 per share, while sales should range from $22.2 billion to $22.9 billion.</p><p>Analysts were expecting an annual profit of $2.77 per share on sales of $22.81.</p>"

And high winds hiked fire risks in several states.</p><p>Why was it happening?</p><p>Three things explained the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/winter-weather-united-states-storm-heat-dbbb5939c655a9a6e28ade6401b7ec88\">weird weather</a> in <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/united-states-warm-weather-3427ffe07907ea245279e3e21ffdebac\">much of the U.S.</a></p><p>This band of strong winds keeps warm air, which blows up from the south, trapped below cold air that comes down from the north. The jet stream constantly shifts. Recently, it's been sitting far north enough to mean that warm air has been blasting the normally frigid Upper Midwest.</p><p>“The orientation of it right now is not very winter-like,” said Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland.</p><p>In all weather science, it’s virtually impossible to directly attribute any individual phenomenon to a specific cause. How global warming affects the position of the jet stream is a case in point.</p><p>But climate change, caused by human activities that release plant-warming gasses like carbon dioxide, is causing global temperatures to be warmer than normal.

            "article_content": "<p>NEW YORK — Sean “Diddy” Combs was sued Monday by a music producer who accused the hip-hop mogul of sexually assaulting him and forcing him to have sex with prostitutes.</p><p>The suit, filed in federal court in New York, accuses Combs of repeated instances of unsolicited groping and sexual touching. It also says the man had to work in a bathroom while Combs showered and walked around naked.</p><p>A lawyer for Combs called the events described in the lawsuit “pure fiction.”</p><p>“We have overwhelming, indisputable proof that his claims are complete lies,” said Combs attorney Shawn Holley. “We will address these outlandish allegations in court and take all appropriate action against those who make them,” he added.</p><p>A lawyer, Tyrone Blackburn, who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the producer did not immediately return an email seeking comment. The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to being identified or decide to tell their stories publicly.</p><p>In the lawsuit, the producer claims Combs made him solicit prostitutes and pressured him to have sex with them. It also described a time when the producer woke up in bed with two sex workers, suspecting he had been drugged.</p><p>The legal claim is one of several <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-rape-lawsuit-53e664171385e8704a9c4135262b888a\">sexual assault lawsuits</a> filed against Combs in recent months, including a lawsuit from the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/diddy-sean-combs-cassie-lawsuit-e3681f1abbe38c11d829c269c9a89260\">R&amp;B singer Cassie</a> that was settled last year.

            "article_content": "<p>CLEVELAND — While the signs of spring are welcome, the allergies that come along are not.</p><p><a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/6675-sandra-hong\">Dr. Sandra Hong, Cleveland Clinic Chair of the Department of Allergy and Immunology</a>, says now is the time to prepare for the season.</p><p>\"Valentine's Day, think of your allergist, but I would say now is perfect to start treatment,\" Hong told 3News. \"If they know their symptoms are about to start up, I would start those nasal steroid nasal sprays now, because they can take a little bit of time to work, the antihistamines. They can start when their symptoms really start up with the itching and the sneezing.\"</p><p>Tree pollen, grass, and even mold (thanks to the rainy days coming our way) are the biggest culprits of spring allergies. Usually, most people wait until allergy season is in full swing before they start taking allergy medication. </p><p>\"If you have a history of allergies, you've got a much higher risk of having asthma just alone,\" Hong explained. \"If you notice, 'Every springtime, I start to get kind of short of breath or I wheeze,' I absolutely would love for you to see your physician so that they can actually try to start you on some medications that can benefit. Wheezing is not normal, so if you wheeze, someone should be evaluating you.\"</p><p>While the medications can help with hay fever, runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, watery eyes, now is a good time to start using some of them.</p><p>It's important to remember the cold and flu season isn't over, so be aware those sneezes and sniffles could be related to a virus. Allergies usually come with itchy and watery eyes, ears, and throat, as well as wheezing and long-lasting symptoms. Cold or flu can include fever, chills, sore throat, and body aches.</p><p>Experts say you shouldn't use nasal steroid sprays for colds or flu. Hong also advises caution when using nasal decongestants too. </p><p>\"We as allergists and physicians really don't love our patients using any of the nasal decongestants, and the reason for it is that if they use these medications for more than three to five days, the nose can get addicted to those medications,\" she said. \"They don't get addicted to nasal steroids or antihistamines, but the nasal decongestants can be very, very addictive, so that when they stop using it, they get super stuffy more than even when they started.\"</p><p>Additionally, Hone just attended the annual American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology conference in Washington, D.C., where Cleveland Clinic presented findings from nine years of research into potentially curing young children of food allergies.</p><p>Any parent of a child who has a severe food allergy often lives in fear of exposure and the nightmare of an anaphylactic reaction. <a href=\"https://newsroom.clevelandclinic.org/2023/08/03/cleveland-clinic-researchers-confirm-early-intervention-curbs-peanut-allergies-in-babies/\">Cleveland Clinic has been testing immunotherapy on children under the age of 4</a>, and the research indicates if the child gets early intervention before age 4, there's a possibility the allergy can be cured. Intervention includes giving miniscule amounts of the food the child is allergic to to help build tolerance.  </p><p>\"Once they get to 4 years and above, typically the patient will live with that allergy lifelong, and they'll be therapies like immunotherapy out there,\" Hong, who also serves as the Clinic's medical director for the <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/respiratory/depts/food-allergies\" id=\"isPasted\">Food Allergy Center of Excellence</a>, stated. \"However, the problem is they live with it as opposed to the possibility of a cure, and we're getting 80 to 90% improvement. We're one of the only academic centers in the country that are doing this therapy, and we've been doing it for about nine years now.</p><p>\"Our studies are actually showing improvement and patients do amazingly well. We have patients coming to us from the tri-state area from all over the country for this therapy because there's not many people doing it out there.</p><p>So how does a parent know if their child has a food allergy?</p><p>\"Very frequently, there are the highly allergenic foods, such as peanut, egg, milk, wheat, soy, tree nuts, and seafood and shellfish,\" Hong said. \"So when these foods are introduced to the diet, if they notice symptoms and very frequently in the really young ones below the age of 2, it's actually rashes, they'll have hives, or they'll vomit for you.\"</p><p>Hong advises anyone who has an allergic reaction to any food or environmental substance to talk to an allergist and consider getting a skin test. Treatments can vary from allergy shots to sublingual immunotherapy, which is a small pill placed under the tongue for those who prefer to avoid shots.</p><p>Other research out of the annual conference included the findings of <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-medication-help-reduce-allergic-reactions-multiple-foods-after-accidental\">Xolair</a>, an allergic asthma medication first approved in 2003. </p><p>In 2017 the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched a study of 177 kids, aged 1 to 17, who were allergic to peanuts and two more foods, such as tree nuts, milk, eggs, or wheat. The study was published in the <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2312382\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, and the drug is now available to anyone aged 1 and older. But Hong says not everyone will qualify for the drug, and they must be aware of the side effects.</p><p>\"Ironically, people can have allergic reactions to Xolair,\" she added. \"We need to make sure that patients are monitored, to make sure that they can tolerate the medication without allergic reactions. There are also black box warnings on it that include an increased risk [of] cerebrovascular issues like heart attacks, TIAs like transient ischemic attacks, and blood clots. But that being said, I think an allergist would be able to work through, like, who would be an amazing candidate for this medication.\"</p>"
