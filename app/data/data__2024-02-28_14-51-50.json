            "article_content": "<p>WILKES-BARRE, Pa. — <em>NOTE: The above video is from an earlier story.</em></p><p>The defense attorneys who asked the state Supreme Court to exercise extraordinary powers and decide the legality of law enforcement's use of \"predator catcher\" evidence to prosecute would-be child abusers are \"making a mountain out of a molehill” and the high court should refuse to intervene, <a href=\"https://www.wnep.com/section/luzerne-county\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Luzerne County</a> prosecutors argued in new court filings.</p><p>The county district attorney’s office rejected claims Musa Harris — known online as the <a href=\"https://www.wnep.com/article/news/local/luzerne-county/meet-musa-harris-the-luzerne-county-predator-catcher/523-6e0860e6-c7b0-427a-84e5-f95b027d3856\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">“Luzerne County predator catcher”</a> and as “cooperating witness” in numerous charging documents — is a vigilante.

The person who notes the license plate of a car leaving the scene of a shooting, the passerby that steps in to stop an assault, or the customer who stops a robbery are not considered vigilantes, even when they may detain a suspect until the police arrive.”</p><p>“While law enforcement discourages such activity, especially when the citizen could be endangered, it does not ignore the information that is provided by the citizen who intervenes,” he continued.</p><p>The responses come roughly two weeks after a group of defense attorneys filed petitions imploring the high court to use its “King’s Bench” powers to decide the legality of using evidence gathered by Harris and others like him.</p><p>The attorneys represent people criminally charged after they were caught in online child sex stings orchestrated by citizens, not the police. They are attorneys William Abraham and Ellen Granahan, on behalf of Rodney Albertson; attorney William Watt, on behalf of Zachary Mitchell; and attorney Joseph Sklarosky, on behalf of John Davenport.</p><p>Harris, who says he’s exposed more than 620 people since 2020, poses as a child online and agrees to meet with grown men he chats with for the purpose of sex. When Harris arrives at the meet up, he goes live on social media and exposes the alleged would-be abuser.</p><p>Information he provided to law enforcement as a “confidential witness” pushed prosecutions forward on several cases. </p><p>“These are not the acts of a vigilante,” McMonagle wrote. “Instead, they are the acts of a person who, while being advised against this activity, is doing what he can to assist police in safeguarding the well-being of children in Luzerne County.”</p><p>The attorneys representing some of those criminally charged are seeking the high court’s intervention to prevent “irreparable harm.” The defense attorneys argue the statutes under which their clients are charged only empower law enforcement officers to act in undercover stings.</p><p>Proposed legislation that would amend the unlawful contact with a minor statute and allow anyone to pose as a minor never moved out of the House judiciary committee. Lawmakers “expressed a clear legislative intent” to narrow the scope of those authorized to investigate, the defense attorneys argued.</p><p>In this week’s responses, the district attorney’s office pushed back by arguing the issue is not sufficiently important to warrant immediate intervention by the courts through use of “King’s Bench” powers.</p><p>Those powers, based on English common law, allow the high court to weigh in on cases pending in lower courts — or even on matters that are not in the judicial system — when need arises to address issues of “immediate public importance,” according to the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts.</p><p>The state Supreme Court rarely exercises such a power. When it has, it did so to settle issues involving election disputes, public employee strikes, prison overcrowding, judicial misconduct and legislative powers, according to the AOPC.</p><p>“Predator catcher” assistance to police does not fit the bill, county prosecutors said.</p><p>“It (King’s Bench power) is not meant to be used as a vehicle to bypass the normal adjudicative process,” McMonagle wrote. “Petitioner's efforts to have his case dismissed has been denied at every turn. He can make these arguments in the normal process of the criminal justice system. If he is convicted, he may raise these issues on appeal.\"</p><p>\"He should not be able to bypass this process by requesting this Honorable Court to exercise a power that is to be used cautiously.”</p>"

            "article_content": "<p>The Biden administration has frequently touted its efforts to forgive student debt. Most recently, on Feb. 21, 2024, the administration announced it has <a href=\"https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/biden-harris-administration-approves-12-billion-loan-forgiveness-over-150000-save-plan-borrowers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">forgiven $138 billion in student loans for 3.9 million borrowers</a> since President Joe Biden first entered office.</p><p>VERIFY reader Diane emailed us to ask if borrowers receiving forgiveness are getting checks, and if borrowers have to use that money on their student loans if they do receive checks.</p><p>Does the federal government send checks for student loan forgiveness?</p><p>No, the federal government does not send checks for student loan forgiveness.</p><p>When the U.S. Department of Education forgives someone’s federal student loan, it simply erases the remaining repayment balance on that loan. It does not issue checks for forgiveness. </p><p>When the government forgives a borrower’s student loan debt, it rids the borrower of their obligation to repay all or a portion of their loan, the Education Department’s <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/difference-between-loan-forgiveness-cancellation-and-discharge\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid</a> website says.</p><p>If the government forgives the full amount of your loan, you won’t have to make any more payments on that loan, <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation#frequently-asked-questions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid</a> says. If only a part of your loan has been forgiven,  the amount you have to pay will be reduced and you’ll still need to pay the remaining balance.</p><p>Or as <a href=\"https://www.debt.org/students/loan-forgiveness/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Debt.org</a>, a debt information resource, puts it: “Forgiveness means all or part of your student loan is wiped away. Poof!” </p><p>There are a couple instances where borrowers could receive checks from the Education Department, but those are for overpayment refunds or loan cancellations. </p><p>One instance is if the Education Department completely cancels a borrower’s student loan that they have already partially or fully paid off, the <a href=\"https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/loan-cancellation-forgiveness-bankruptcy/cancellation-forgiveness-options/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Consumer Law Center (NCLC)</a> says.</p><p>This could happen for a borrower who is granted a closed school discharge, the <a href=\"https://studentloanborrowerassistance.org/for-borrowers/dealing-with-student-loan-debt/loan-cancellation-forgiveness-bankruptcy/cancellation-forgiveness-options/closed-school/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NCLC</a> says. When the Education Department grants this kind of discharge, it cancels the loans the person borrowed to attend the closed school, gives the borrower a refund of payments made on those loans and deletes any negative credit history associated with those loans from the borrower’s credit report.</p><p>The Department of Education may also send refunds to borrowers who have overpaid on student loan debt that has been forgiven. For example, borrowers in the Department of Education’s income-driven repayment program have received refunds for payments made long after they were eligible for forgiveness.</p><p class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__left-message\">The <a class=\"article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link article-verify-follow-subscribe__message-link_bold_true\" href=\"https://www.verifythis.com/?utm_source=desktop_article_embed\" target=\"_blank\">VERIFY</a> team works to separate fact from fiction so that you can understand what is true and false.

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON — <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/mitch-mcconnell\">Mitch McConnell</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.senate.gov/senators/majority-minority-leaders.htm\">longest-serving Senate leader in history</a> who maintained his power in the face of dramatic convulsions in the Republican Party for almost two decades, will step down from that position in November.</p><p>McConnell, who turned 82 last week, was set to announce his decision Wednesday in the well of the Senate, a place where he looked in awe from its back benches in 1985 when he arrived and where he grew increasingly comfortable in the front row seat afforded the party leaders.</p><p>“One of life’s most underappreciated talents is to know when it’s time to move on to life’s next chapter,” he said in prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press. “So I stand before you today ... to say that this will be my last term as Republican leader of the Senate.”</p><p>His decision punctuates a powerful ideological transition underway in the Republican Party, from Ronald Reagan’s brand of traditional conservatism and strong international alliances, to the fiery, often isolationist populism of former President Donald Trump.</p><p>McConnell said he plans to serve out his Senate term, which ends in January 2027, “albeit from a different seat in the chamber.” Aides said McConnell’s announcement about the leadership post was unrelated to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/senate-mitch-mcconnell-freeze-health-concussion-960af7f541b05754011171754acfe94f\">his health</a>. The Kentucky senator had a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-fetterman-feinstein-absence-return-fall-d210f345020c9593ba2940edc71874ac\">concussion</a> from a fall last year and two public episodes <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/senate-gop-leader-mcconnell-health-freeze-up-c5b43745251daa0bb63636ceff4edce2\">where his face briefly froze</a> while <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-freeze-senate-fall-republican-leader-f18008b314c5907ba0111f6891c9a0d3\">he was speaking.</a></p><p>“As I have been thinking about when I would deliver some news to the Senate, I always imagined a moment when I had total clarity and peace about the sunset of my work,” McConnell said in his prepared remarks. “A moment when I am certain I have helped preserve the ideals I so strongly believe. It arrived today.”</p><p>The senator had been under increasing pressure from the restive, and at times hostile wing of his party that has aligned firmly with Trump. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mcconnell-trump-fed-lies-to-mob-36871d68df56a10be1c46ed364ad6de6\">The two have been estranged</a> since <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/mitch-mcconnell-gop-electoral-college-34fb478601b72b3e8049f12371670001\">December 2020</a>, when McConnell refused to abide Trump’s lie that the election of Democrat Joe Biden as president was the product of fraud.</p><p>But while McConnell's critics within the GOP conference had grown louder, their numbers had not grown appreciably larger, a marker of McConnell’s strategic and tactical skill and his ability to understand the needs of his fellow Republican senators.</p><p>McConnell gave no specific reason for the timing of his decision, which he has been contemplating for months, but he cited the recent death of his wife's youngest sister as a moment that prompted introspection. “The end of my contributions are closer than I’d prefer,” McConnell said.</p><p>But his remarks were also light at times as he talked about the arc of his Senate career.</p><p>He noted that when he arrived in the Senate, “I was just happy if anybody remembered my name.” During his campaign in 1984, when Reagan was visiting Kentucky, the president called him “Mitch O’Donnell.”</p><p>McConnell endorsed Reagan’s view of America’s role in the world and the senator has persisted in face of opposition, including from Trump, that Congress should include a foreign assistance package that includes $60 billion for Ukraine.</p><p>“I am unconflicted about the good within our country and the irreplaceable role we play as the leader of the free world,\" McConnell said.</p><p>Against long odds he managed to secure 22 Republican votes for the package now being considered by the House.</p><p>“Believe me, I know the politics within my party at this particular moment in time. I have many faults. Misunderstanding politics is not one of them,\" McConnell said. \"That said, I believe more strongly than ever that America’s global leadership is essential to preserving the shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan discussed. For as long as I am drawing breath on this earth I will defend American exceptionalism.”</p><p>Trump has pulled the party hard to the ideological right, questioning longtime military alliances such as NATO, international trade agreements and pushing for a severe crackdown on immigration, all the while clinging to the falsehood that the election was stolen from him in 2020.</p><p>McConnell and Trump had worked together in Trump’s first term, remaking the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary in a far more conservative image, and on tax legislation. But there was also friction from the start, with Trump frequently sniping at the senator.</p><p>Their relationship has essentially been over since Trump refused to accept the results of the Electoral College. But the rupture deepened dramatically after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. McConnell assigned blame and responsibility to Trump and said that he should be held to account through the criminal justice system for his actions.</p><p>McConnell’s critics insist he could have done more, including voting to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-donald-trump-impeachments-trump-impeachment-mitch-mcconnell-0a14d2e41e376331580b98a992f7d856#:~:text=Mitch%20McConnell%20delivered%20a%20scalding,face%20trial%20in%20the%20Senate.\">McConnell did not</a>, arguing that since Trump was no longer in office, he could not be subject to impeachment.</p><p>Rather than fade from prominence after the Capitol riot, Trump continued to assert his control over the party, and finds himself on a clear glidepath to the Republican nomination. Other members of the Republican Senate leadership have endorsed Trump. McConnell has not, and that has drawn criticism from other Republican senators.</p><p>McConnell’s path to power was hardly linear, but from the day he walked onto the Senate floor in 1985 and took his seat as the most junior Republican senator, he set his sights on being the party leader. What set him apart was that so many other Senate leaders wanted to run for president. McConnell wanted to run the Senate. He lost races for lower party positions before steadily ascending, and finally became party leader in 2006 and has won nine straight elections.</p><p>He most recently <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/florida-mitch-mcconnell-congress-9f1be1d3635127dbb3e17a3fae1ac86d\">beat back a challenge</a> led by Sen. Rick Scott of Florida last November.</p><p>McConnell built his power base by a combination of care and nurturing of his members, including understanding their political imperatives. After seeing the potential peril of a rising Tea Party, he also established a super political action committee, The Senate Leadership Fund, which has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Republican candidates.</p><p>Despite the concerns about his health, colleagues have said in recent months that they believe he has recovered. McConnell was not impaired cognitively, but did have some additional physical limitations.</p><p>“I love the Senate,” he said in his prepared remarks. “It has been my life. There may be more distinguished members of this body throughout our history, but I doubt there are any with more admiration for it.”</p><p>But, he added, \"Father Time remains undefeated. I am no longer the young man sitting in the back, hoping colleagues would remember my name. It is time for the next generation of leadership.”</p><p>There would be a time to reminisce, he said, but not today.</p><p>“I still have enough gas in the tank to thoroughly disappoint my critics and I intend to do so with all the enthusiasm which they have become accustomed.”</p>"

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON — After making national headlines this week over its plans for \"dynamic pricing,\" Wendy's is working to clarify that it doesn't intend to raise prices during peak times after all and won't implement surge pricing. </p><p>In an investor call on Feb. 15, Kirk Tanner, the president and CEO of the fast food chain, announced they would be testing a fluctuating price model in the future, which he called \"dynamic pricing,\" as a way to change prices and menu offerings on the fly at various restaurants. </p><p>When asked Tuesday morning about the \"dynamic pricing\" plans, Wendy's confirmed it would test dynamic pricing as early as next year, saying it would bring additional \"flexibility to change the menu more easily and to offer discounts and value offers to our customers.\"</p><p>\"As early as 2025, we plan to test a number of features such as AI-enabled menu changes and suggestive selling based on factors such as weather that we think will provide great value and an improved customer and crew experience,\" Wendy's said in its initial statement. </p><p>Throughout Monday and Tuesday, multiple media reports likened the plans to surge charges on ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, where customers are charged more during times when demand is high. </p><p>The phrase \"dynamic pricing\" is widely known as \"the quick rise or drop in prices based on demand,\" <a href=\"https://apnews.com/5add655fbe524715af2fc0b652f54736\">according to the Associated Press.</a> \"At places that use this pricing strategy, it may cost more to go on a Saturday, when everyone else is buying tickets.\"</p><p>Hours after releasing the initial statement, Wendy's clarified late Tuesday night that the dynamic pricing test would not be used to raise prices, and would instead be used exclusively to offer discounts. </p><p>\"Wendy’s will not implement surge pricing, which is the practice of raising prices when demand is highest,\" a spokesperson for the fast food chain wrote. \"We didn't use that phrase, nor do we plan to implement that practice.\" </p><p>The company said their initial announcement during the investor call was misinterpreted.</p><p>\"This was misconstrued in some media reports as an intent to raise prices when demand is highest at our restaurants,\" <a href=\"https://www.wendys.com/blog/wendys-digital-news-update\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the statement reads</a>. \"We have no plans to do that and would not raise prices when our customers are visiting us most. Any features we may test in the future would be designed to benefit our customers and restaurant crew members.\" </p><p>The company said it plans to use digital menu boards to offer discounts and special offers to customers during slower times of the day, when fewer customers are in their restaurants. </p><p>\"Digital menu boards could allow us to change the menu offerings at different times of day and offer discounts and value offers to our customers more easily, particularly in the slower times of day,\" Wendy's said in its follow-up statement. </p><p>Although the company's Q4 earnings report was shared earlier in the month, reporting about the dynamic pricing plans only began picking up traction this week. </p><p>By Tuesday, the fast food chain was trending on social media platforms over the news. On X, formerly Twitter, more than 860,000 posts about Wendy's were circulating, with users largely annoyed by how the perceived change could impact fast food prices. </p><p>In the initial call with investors on Feb. 15, Tanner said the company would spend around $20 million over the next two years to establish digital menu boards that will allow restaurants to change prices on the fly. </p><p>Tanner also revealed that Wendy's was using its own internal AI model - named \"Frosty\" - in several restaurants. While he didn't specify what exactly the AI was doing, he told investors that the company was seeing \"ongoing improvement in speed and accuracy\" at those locations. </p>"

            "article_content": "<p>SCRANTON, Pa. — The work of C. Edgar Patience can be found all over the <a href=\"http://www.anthracitemuseum.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Anthracite Heritage Museum</strong></a> in Scranton as well as on display in museums and collections around the country.</p><p>\"We have called him and sculptor. We have called him an artist, but when I was dealing with the people at the museum, they have distinct classifications of people. And they consider my father a craftsman,\" said Juanita Patience-Moss, the daughter of C. Edgar Patience.</p><p>Now in her 90s, Juanita Patience-Moss remains a proponent of her father's work. His sculptures, busts, souvenirs, and jewelry are all made from anthracite coal. Much of the art was made by Patience in his workshop in West Pittston.</p><p>\"The dust would be so thick it would be like fog. I'd open the door and call 'Daddy!' I never went in there. And that's what killed him; all that coal dust destroyed his lungs.\"</p><p>Patience died in 1972, but his work is still studied by historians and art enthusiasts.</p><p>\"This is the first item that you see in the Anthracite Heritage Museum because we use this to actually talk about the properties of anthracite coal,\" said John Fielding, the museum's curator.</p><p>Some of his art demonstrates how anthracite—an energy source and art medium—is mined, something Fielding says is not an easy thing to do.</p><p>\"Anthracite coal, it's not really stable, so it's very hard to work with. One little error can ruin an entire piece.\"</p><p>Luckily, Patience already had the patience to work with anthracite coal.</p><p>\"He loved his work, and he was patient with it. What things did break you just start all over again,\" Patience-Moss said.</p><p>What he had to learn was perseverance, something he didn't have to look outside of his family tree to find.</p><p>\"My great-grandfather, who ran away from slavery itself at age 17, joined the Union Army. And the idea was to fight for freedom for his people. And that's why he did it. so, there's perseverance right there,\" Patience-Moss said.</p><p>Patience then demonstrated perseverance with his work, setting an example for his children.</p><p>\"He loved what he did, no doubt about that. He never did anything else his whole life. He was always working with his father. When his father passed away, he continued to work.\"</p><p>Patience-Moss says that perseverance was then passed on to her.</p><p>\"Perhaps it's genetic. Who knows? I don't know. Yes, I had a lot of perseverance because I went back to college after being out for two years, many years, 44 years, and I went back to Wilkes College, and I was probably the only married woman in the class at that time in 1958.\"</p><p>Perseverance is what Patience-Moss says she wants her father to be remembered for the most. And we don't have to travel far to see examples of the perseverance of C. Edgar Patience in Scranton.</p><p>    </p>"

            "article_content": "<p>LOUISVILLE, Colo. — Dr. Dawn Owens Robinson has been caring for women and their infants as an OBGYN for more than 23 years. </p><p>In that time, she's seen firsthand <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9914526/#:~:text=Black%20women%20have%20a%20maternal,providers%20in%20the%20United%20States\">the disparities facing Black women in health care</a>. </p><p>\"It's generational, it's historical and it's ongoing today,\" said Owens Robinson, an OBGYN at AdventHealth Avista in Louisville.</p><p>\"So if we're talking maternal and pregnant women, we are three to four times more likely to die in childbirth or the first 42 days after delivery,\" she said. \"Black babies are two and a half times more likely to die in the first year of life. A study out of Florida showed that Black babies had a 50% higher chance of death if they had a white pediatrician.<strong> </strong>So there are significant deficits and delinquencies, or whatever titles or names you want to put with it, when it comes to care for Black women and people of color in general.”</p><p>When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8020496/\">why these disparities exist</a>, Owens Robinson said access to care is too simple an answer. </p><p>\"It's because of lack of income, lack of jobs, lack of employment, lack of insurance, racism – institutional, systemic in the health care system,\" she said. \"It's lack of generational wealth, it's lack of food, it's food deserts, maternal deserts, the list goes on.\"</p><p>Owens Robinson said <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843483/\">racism plays a clear factor in the care Black women receive</a>, even now.</p><p>\"They did a study before COVID, a survey of white med students. And they still think we have thicker skin and don't need as much pain medicine. And that was this decade,\" she said. </p><p>Having these massive disparities isn't just frustrating, it can be deadly.</p><p>\"Frustrating puts it -- I think that makes it mild,\" Owens Robinson said. \"People want to say it's access and people want to say it's poor. But Dr. Shalon Irving worked for the CDC epidemiology department, she had two Ph.D.s, two master's degrees and was fighting this same subject. And 15 days after delivery died.\"</p><p>She said having a provider who looks like you and understands you makes a big impact.</p><p>\"Studies have shown that our Black babies survive better, we listen better, we do better when the providers in front of us have similar cultural backgrounds and respect for where we're coming from,\" Owens Robinson said. </p><p>She's seen the difference it makes firsthand.</p><p>\"And when you walk into a room, even with a mask on, you could see their face light up. You could see their shoulders drop down. You could see them smiling beneath the mask, because they're like 'oh, this doctor looks like me,'\" she said. \"So I think it's just a level of comfort and trust.\"</p><p>Still, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/21/health/black-doctors-shortage-us/index.html\">CNN reports</a> less than 6% of physicians in the U.S. are Black.</p><p>Owens Robinson said she knew she wanted to be a physician at just 5 years old. Counselors tried in middle school and high school to deter her, steering her toward teaching. She said graduating from medical school with her family cheering her on, and now serving women, means so much. </p><p>\"I think it's even more meaningful 23 years later. I tell patients sometimes I cry at deliveries, and I tell fathers, this is a miracle. I'm involved in the miracle of life every day. So I'm blessed,\" she said. </p><p>That drive to help others is now what helps her advocate for a more equitable health care system. She knows solutions won't be simple or fast, but it's a path forward that needs to begin. </p><p>\"And I think that's where it starts. I think we need to look at ourselves and see where we can do better,\" Owens Robinson said. </p><p>As for what can be done to improve these disparities, Owens Robinson said implicit bias training in health care should be mandatory. And when it comes to preventing a disease, illness or cancer, she said education is key. </p><p>For OBGYNs, she said having midwives and doulas in the delivery rooms can make a massive difference in creating positive outcomes for both mom and baby. And for the doctors themselves, listening to their patients and really hearing what they say is critical. </p><p>“And then, the bigger problems are dealing with institutional, systemic racism. And my colleague asked, 'Well how do we fix that?' I said that started 400 years ago when our toes touched the soil. We’re not going to fix it in 400 days,\" Owens Robinson said. \"It’s a generational, systemic institutional broken system and it’s going to take multiple tears and years and people to get involved and to care to make a difference.\"</p><p><span id=\"isPasted\" lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>SUGGESTED VIDEOS: </strong></span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlV2Iuo79CupkSY4k2yYaNeC9EBXhNCjI\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><strong>Telling Black Stories</strong></span></a></p>"

Authorities were deluged with tips, rumors and theories but struggled to get witnesses to open up.</p><p>“It’s no mystery why it took years to indict and arrest the defendants,” Breon Peace, the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, told reporters after Tuesday's verdict. He said key witnesses “were terrified that they would be retaliated against if they cooperated with law enforcement.\"</p><p>“Their strength and resolve in testifying at this trial were a triumph of right over wrong and courage over fear,” Peace added.</p><p>Jordan, 40, was Mizell's godson. Washington, 59, was an old friend who was bunking at the home of the DJ’s sister at the time of the shooting on Oct. 30, 2002. Both men were <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-ap-top-news-new-york-city-hip-hop-and-rap-ny-state-wire-2c2c9d4886526e6d304fe495dd62e29b\">arrested in 2020</a> and pleaded not guilty.</p><p>“Y’all just killed two innocent people,” Washington yelled at jurors following the guilty verdict. Jordan’s supporters also erupted at the verdict, cursing the jury.</p><p>Defense lawyers said they asked the judge to set aside the verdict and acquit them.</p><p>“My client did not do this. And the jury heard testimony about the person who did,\" one of Washington’s lawyers, Susan Kellman, told reporters.</p><p>The men’s names, or at least their nicknames, have been floated for decades in connection to the case. Authorities publicly named Washington as a suspect in 2007. He told Playboy magazine in 2003 he’d been outside the studio, heard the shots and saw “Little D” — one of Jordan’s monikers — racing out of the building.</p><p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/music-general-news-331470f3c4d442abb214f7e86ee760d2\">Relatives of Mizell</a> welcomed the verdict and lamented that his mother did not live to see it.</p><p>“I feel like I was carrying a 2,000-pound weight on my shoulders. And when that verdict came today, it lifted it off,” said Carlis Thompson, Mizell's cousin, who wiped away tears after the verdict was read. “The wounds can start to heal now.\"</p><p>Mizell had been part of Run-D.M.C.’s anti-drug message, delivered through a public service announcement and such lyrics as “we are not thugs / we don’t use drugs.” But according to prosecutors and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-run-dmc-murder-trial-e6d4ce2e42e7f542f072a1ae17feb7bb\">trial testimony</a>, he racked up debts after the group’s heyday and moonlighted as a cocaine middleman to cover his bills and habitual generosity to friends.</p><p>“He was a man who got involved in the drug game to take care of the people who depended on him,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Artie McConnell said in his summation.</p><p>Prosecution witnesses testified that in Mizell’s final months, he had a plan to acquire 10 kilograms of cocaine and sell it through Jordan, Washington and a Baltimore-based dealer. But the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-run-dmc-murder-trial-e6d4ce2e42e7f542f072a1ae17feb7bb\">Baltimore connection refused to work with Washington</a>, according to testimony.</p><p>Prosecutors said Washington and Jordan went after Mizell for the sake of vengeance, greed and jealousy.</p><p>Two eyewitnesses, former studio aide <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-murder-trial-run-dmc-7a9c89f35f06e45f6c40937deaa02ca1\">Uriel Rincon</a> and former Mizell business manager Lydia High, testified that Washington blocked the door and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-run-dmc-murder-trial-e6d4ce2e42e7f542f072a1ae17feb7bb\">ordered High to lie on the floor</a>. She said he brandished a gun.</p><p>Rincon identified Jordan as the man who approached Mizell and exchanged a friendly greeting moments before shots rang out and one bullet <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-murder-trial-run-dmc-7a9c89f35f06e45f6c40937deaa02ca1\">wounded Rincon himself</a>. Three other people, including <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-run-dmc-murder-trial-01abc60fe4984828f8a8662412e5233a\">a teenage singer who had just stopped by</a> the studio to tout her demo tape, testified that they were in an adjoining room and heard but didn’t see what happened.</p><p>Other witnesses testified that Washington and Jordan made incriminating statements about the Mizell killing after it happened.</p><p>Neither Washington nor Jordan testified. Their lawyers questioned key prosecution witnesses’ credibility and their memories of the long-ago shooting, noting that some initially denied they could identify the attackers or had heard who they were.</p><p>“Virtually every witness changed their testimony 180 degrees,” Kellman told the judge during legal arguments.</p><p>The witnesses said they had been overwhelmed, loath to pass along secondhand information or scared for their lives.</p><p>The trial shed limited light on <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/jam-master-jay-killing-rundmc-2f110aba4cfb55ae59b47042e3e0fed1\">a third defendant</a>, Jay Bryant, who was charged last year after prosecutors said his DNA was found on a hat at the scene. They assert that he slipped into the studio building and let Washington and Jordan in through fire door in the back so they could avoid buzzing up.</p><p>Bryant has pleaded not guilty and is headed toward a separate trial.</p><p>Testimony suggested that he knew someone in common with his co-defendants, but there’s no indication that Bryant was close with Mizell, if indeed they ever met.</p><p>Bryant’s uncle testified that his nephew told him he shot Mizell after the DJ reached for a gun, a scenario no other witnesses described.</p><p>McConnell said Bryant was “involved, but he’s not the killer.” Prosecutors’ theory doesn’t even place Bryant in the studio, though that’s where authorities found the hat with DNA from him and other people — but not the other defendants, according to court filings.</p><p>One of Jordan's lawyers, Michael Hueston, said in his summation that Bryant “is literally reasonable doubt.”</p><p>The verdict comes a month before the 40th anniversary of Run-D.M.C.'s self-titled debut album, which included a track titled “Jam Master Jay,” Peace noted. The song lauded Mizell as “on his way / to be the best DJ in the US of A.”</p><p>The group — also featuring Darryl “DMC” McDaniels and Joseph Simmons, known as DJ Run and Rev. Run — became the first rappers with gold and platinum albums and was the first hip-hop outfit with a video in regular rotation on MTV.</p><p>While the case may complicate Mizell’s image, Syracuse University media professor J. Christopher Hamilton says it shouldn’t be blotted out.</p><p>If he was indeed involved in dealing drugs, “that doesn’t mean to say his achievements shouldn’t be lauded,” Hamilton said, arguing that acceptance from local underworld figures was a necessity for successful rappers of the ’80s and ’90s.</p><p>“You don’t get these individuals without them walking through the gauntlet of the street,” Hamilton said.</p>"

This is a strategy that has already taken hold with ride-sharing companies, such as <a href=\"https://www.uber.com/us/en/marketplace/pricing/surge-pricing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Uber</a> and <a href=\"https://help.lyft.com/hc/ru/all/articles/115012925707-Ride-pricing-and-charges\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lyft</a>, and ticket sellers like <a href=\"https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/partner/resale-dynamic-pricing/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ticketmaster</a>.</p><p>As the news circulated online, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/24chadster/status/1762485064380633208\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SeanDoesALot1/status/1762486691640606763\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">people</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/J_Butler05/status/1762438476538994815\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevesdaily/status/1762476785785053628\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">social</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlieray/status/1762210437355958364\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">media</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptoMidnite/status/1762502060115927098\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">wondered</a> if Wendy’s is really planning to implement dynamic or surge pricing at its restaurants next year.</p><p>We VERIFY what Wendy’s dynamic pricing plan will look like for customers. </p><p>Is Wendy’s planning to implement dynamic pricing in 2025?</p><p>Yes, Wendy’s is planning to implement dynamic pricing in 2025.</p><p>Wendy’s confirmed it plans to roll out dynamic pricing as early as 2025.
