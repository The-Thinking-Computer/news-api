It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p>\n<p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p>\n<p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million are packed into Rafah near the border with Egypt.</p>\n<p>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p>\n<p>The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response.

Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p>\n<p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT TOOK PLACE DURING HAMAS ATTACK, ISRAELI ASSOCIATION SAYS</h3>\n<p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p>\n<p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p>\n<p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p>\n<p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p>\n<p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE KILLS A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER IN SOUTHERN LEBANON</h3>\n<p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p>\n<p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p>\n<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p>\n<p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAELI STRIKES ACROSS GAZA KILL 67 PALESTINIANS OVERNIGHT</h3>\n<p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p>\n<p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p>\n<p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p>\n<p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p>\n<p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p>\n<p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 KILLED IN GAZA WHERE PALESTINIANS WERE TOLD TO SHELTER, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS SAYS</h3>\n<p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p>\n<p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p>\n<p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p>\n<p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">QATAR SAYS HAMAS IS DELIVERING MEDICATION TO ISRAELI HOSTAGES</h3>\n<p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p>\n<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p>\n<p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SUSPENDS AID IN NORTHERN GAZA </h3>\n<p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p>\n<p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p>\n<p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p>\n<p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p>\n<p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p>\n<p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ATTACKS SHOW YEMEN’S HOUTHIS CAN STILL FIGHT DESPITE U.S.-LED AIRSTRIKES </h3>\n<p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p>\n<p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p>\n<p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p>\n<p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p>\n<p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BRITAIN’S PRINCE WILLIAM LAMENTS ‘SHEER SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING’</h3>\n<p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p>\n<p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p>\n<p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p>\n<p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.S. VETOES ARAB-BACKED U.N. CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION</h3>\n<p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p>\n<p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p>\n<p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p>\n<p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>\n<div class=\"article-content-cta-group\">\n</div>\n</div><p>New attempts are underway to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war in Gaza, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet said late Wednesday.</p><p>“Initial signs indicate a possibility of moving forward,” said Benny Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister. It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p><p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p><p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million are packed into Rafah near the border with Egypt.</p><p>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry estimates more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p><p>Currently:</p><p>— U.S. vetoes Arab-backed UN Security Council cease-fire resolution</p><p>— A U.N. agency says it can’t deliver aid to northern Gaza because of chaos, and famine fears are rising</p><p>— Attacks on ships and U.S. drones show Yemen’s Houthis can still fight despite U.S.-led airstrikes</p><p>— More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says</p><p>— Israel orders new evacuations in northern Gaza, where U.N. says 1 in 6 children are malnourished</p><p>— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.</p><p>Here’s the latest:</p><p>JERUSALEM — A member of Israel’s three-person War Cabinet says there are new attempts underway to reach a cease-fire deal to pause the war in Gaza.</p><p>But Benny Gantz says Israel is ready to press ahead with its offensive in the southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, despite widespread international opposition.</p><p>Israel is seeking the release of the more than 100 hostages that Hamas is still holding in Gaza.

The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p><p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p><p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p><p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p><p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p><p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p><p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p><p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p><p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p><p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p><p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>"

It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p>\n<p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p>\n<p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.

About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry estimates more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-live-updates-2-killed-in-gaza-where-palestinians-were-seeking-shelter-doctors-without-borders\",\"pos\":\"mr1_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>Currently:</p>\n<p>— U.S. vetoes Arab-backed UN Security Council cease-fire resolution</p>\n<p>— A U.N. agency says it can’t deliver aid to northern Gaza because of chaos, and famine fears are rising</p>\n<p>— Attacks on ships and U.S. drones show Yemen’s Houthis can still fight despite U.S.-led airstrikes</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-live-updates-2-killed-in-gaza-where-palestinians-were-seeking-shelter-doctors-without-borders\",\"pos\":\"mr2_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>— More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says</p>\n<p>— Israel orders new evacuations in northern Gaza, where U.N. says 1 in 6 children are malnourished</p>\n<p>— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.</p>\n<p>Here’s the latest:</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr3_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-live-updates-2-killed-in-gaza-where-palestinians-were-seeking-shelter-doctors-without-borders\",\"pos\":\"mr3_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr3_ab-mr3_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr3_ab-mr3_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAEL’S GANTZ SAYS NEW ATTEMPTS AT CEASE-FIRE ARE UNDERWAY</h3>\n<p>JERUSALEM — A member of Israel’s three-person War Cabinet says there are new attempts underway to reach a cease-fire deal to pause the war in Gaza.</p>\n<p>But Benny Gantz says Israel is ready to press ahead with its offensive in the southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, despite widespread international opposition.</p>\n<p>Israel is seeking the release of the more than 100 hostages that Hamas is still holding in Gaza.

Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p>\n<p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT TOOK PLACE DURING HAMAS ATTACK, ISRAELI ASSOCIATION SAYS</h3>\n<p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p>\n<p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p>\n<p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p>\n<p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p>\n<p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE KILLS A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER IN SOUTHERN LEBANON</h3>\n<p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p>\n<p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p>\n<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p>\n<p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago.

Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p>\n<p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p>\n<p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p>\n<p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p>\n<p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 KILLED IN GAZA WHERE PALESTINIANS WERE TOLD TO SHELTER, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS SAYS</h3>\n<p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p>\n<p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p>\n<p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p>\n<p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">QATAR SAYS HAMAS IS DELIVERING MEDICATION TO ISRAELI HOSTAGES</h3>\n<p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p>\n<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p>\n<p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SUSPENDS AID IN NORTHERN GAZA </h3>\n<p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p>\n<p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p>\n<p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p>\n<p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p>\n<p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p>\n<p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ATTACKS SHOW YEMEN’S HOUTHIS CAN STILL FIGHT DESPITE U.S.-LED AIRSTRIKES </h3>\n<p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p>\n<p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p>\n<p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p>\n<p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p>\n<p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BRITAIN’S PRINCE WILLIAM LAMENTS ‘SHEER SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING’</h3>\n<p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p>\n<p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p>\n<p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p>\n<p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.S. VETOES ARAB-BACKED U.N. CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION</h3>\n<p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p>\n<p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p>\n<p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p>\n<p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>\n<div class=\"article-content-cta-group\">\n</div>\n</div><p>New attempts are underway to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war in Gaza, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet said late Wednesday.</p><p>“Initial signs indicate a possibility of moving forward,” said Benny Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister. It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p><p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p><p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million are packed into Rafah near the border with Egypt.</p><p>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry estimates more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p><p>Currently:</p><p>— U.S. vetoes Arab-backed UN Security Council cease-fire resolution</p><p>— A U.N. agency says it can’t deliver aid to northern Gaza because of chaos, and famine fears are rising</p><p>— Attacks on ships and U.S. drones show Yemen’s Houthis can still fight despite U.S.-led airstrikes</p><p>— More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says</p><p>— Israel orders new evacuations in northern Gaza, where U.N. says 1 in 6 children are malnourished</p><p>— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.</p><p>Here’s the latest:</p><p>JERUSALEM — A member of Israel’s three-person War Cabinet says there are new attempts underway to reach a cease-fire deal to pause the war in Gaza.</p><p>But Benny Gantz says Israel is ready to press ahead with its offensive in the southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, despite widespread international opposition.</p><p>Israel is seeking the release of the more than 100 hostages that Hamas is still holding in Gaza. Hamas wants an end to the war, withdrawal of all Israeli troops and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>Weeks of efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have so far not yielded a deal. However Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister, said there are “initial signs that indicate the possibility of moving forward.”</p><p>“We will not stop looking for the way and we will not miss any opportunity to bring the girls and boys home,” he added.</p><p>Israel has identified Rafah, a city on the Egyptian border where over half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge, as its next target. It says Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.</p><p>Gantz said Israel will evacuate the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Rafah before striking, but repeated his pledge that the offensive will take place during Ramadan if hostages are not released.</p><p>“I repeat — if there is no outline for the (hostage) release, we will also operate during Ramadan,” he said.</p><p>The U.S. and other members of the international community have urged Israel not to strike Rafah without a plan to protect civilians.</p><p>Ramadan is expected to begin around March 10.</p><p>GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization says he hasn’t spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a decade and will “probably” make contact now, at a time when Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has devastated medical facilities there.</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when asked about his contact with Netanyahu in recent months, said he had not been in touch with the Israeli leader since he served as Ethiopia’s foreign minister in 2014.</p><p>“So probably I will take that as a recommendation and make contact,” Tedros told a WHO news conference on Wednesday, noting that the organization’s country office has been in contact with Israeli authorities.</p><p>Tedros has made repeated heartfelt statements on how Israel’s war in Gaza has decimated the health sector. However, his comments Wednesday were the first time he publicly said he hasn’t tried talking to Netanyahu about the how the war is being conducted.</p><p>Tedros, who led the U.N. health agency’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, has over the years met with many world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, before the pandemic was declared, and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza have repeatedly come under fire by Israel’s military during the monthslong war. Israel has accused the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, of using medical facilities as cover for its operations.</p><p>WHO has listed a total of 754 “attacks on health care” — including strikes that hit ambulances, medical facilities, health care workers and any other attacks that affect the provision of health care — in occupied Palestinian areas since Oct. 7.</p><p>On Tuesday, WHO said 32 patients in critical condition had been transferred from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to other facilities in recent days, after the complex became “non-functional” following an Israeli siege and military raid.</p><p>“The health and humanitarian situation in Gaza is inhumane and continues to deteriorate,” Tedros said in his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p><p>GENEVA — Switzerland will ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the government said Wednesday.</p><p>Under the ban, Swiss authorities can more easily apply preventative measures to deny entry or expel anyone suspected of affiliation with Hamas, and exchange information with foreign authorities more openly in cases of suspected terrorism financing linked to the group.</p><p>The Federal Council, Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch, said the ban will affect Hamas and any potential successor organizations. The Swiss government already listed Hamas as a terror organization just days after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.</p><p>Acts of support for Hamas could be punishable with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, depending on the level of influence in the group, the government said in a statement. However, the ban so far is limited to five years, but it can be extended by parliament.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s parliament has given overwhelming approval to a declaration expressing opposition to international efforts to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.</p><p>Wednesday’s vote, approved by 99 of 120 lawmakers, is not binding but reflects the widespread sentiment in Israel as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza for a fifth month. Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p><p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p><p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p><p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p><p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago.

Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p>\n<p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p>\n<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p>\n<p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p>\n<p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT TOOK PLACE DURING HAMAS ATTACK, ISRAELI ASSOCIATION SAYS</h3>\n<p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p>\n<p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p>\n<p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p>\n<p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p>\n<p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p>\n<p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p>\n<p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE KILLS A WOMAN AND HER DAUGHTER IN SOUTHERN LEBANON</h3>\n<p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p>\n<p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p>\n<p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p>\n<p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p>\n<p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ISRAELI STRIKES ACROSS GAZA KILL 67 PALESTINIANS OVERNIGHT</h3>\n<p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p>\n<p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p>\n<p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p>\n<p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p>\n<p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p>\n<p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2 KILLED IN GAZA WHERE PALESTINIANS WERE TOLD TO SHELTER, DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS SAYS</h3>\n<p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p>\n<p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p>\n<p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p>\n<p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">QATAR SAYS HAMAS IS DELIVERING MEDICATION TO ISRAELI HOSTAGES</h3>\n<p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p>\n<p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p>\n<p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p>\n<p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAM SUSPENDS AID IN NORTHERN GAZA </h3>\n<p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p>\n<p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p>\n<p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p>\n<p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p>\n<p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p>\n<p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ATTACKS SHOW YEMEN’S HOUTHIS CAN STILL FIGHT DESPITE U.S.-LED AIRSTRIKES </h3>\n<p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p>\n<p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p>\n<p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p>\n<p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p>\n<p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">BRITAIN’S PRINCE WILLIAM LAMENTS ‘SHEER SCALE OF HUMAN SUFFERING’</h3>\n<p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p>\n<p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p>\n<p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p>\n<p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p>\n<p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.S. VETOES ARAB-BACKED U.N. CEASE-FIRE RESOLUTION</h3>\n<p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p>\n<p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p>\n<p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p>\n<p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p>\n<p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>\n<div class=\"article-content-cta-group\">\n</div>\n</div><p>New attempts are underway to reach a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas that could pause the war in Gaza, a member of Israel’s War Cabinet said late Wednesday.</p><p>“Initial signs indicate a possibility of moving forward,” said Benny Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister. It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p><p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p><p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million are packed into Rafah near the border with Egypt.</p><p>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response. Gaza’s Health Ministry estimates more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed.</p><p>Currently:</p><p>— U.S. vetoes Arab-backed UN Security Council cease-fire resolution</p><p>— A U.N. agency says it can’t deliver aid to northern Gaza because of chaos, and famine fears are rising</p><p>— Attacks on ships and U.S. drones show Yemen’s Houthis can still fight despite U.S.-led airstrikes</p><p>— More than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel-Hamas war, Gaza Health Ministry says</p><p>— Israel orders new evacuations in northern Gaza, where U.N. says 1 in 6 children are malnourished</p><p>— Find more of AP’s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.</p><p>Here’s the latest:</p><p>JERUSALEM — A member of Israel’s three-person War Cabinet says there are new attempts underway to reach a cease-fire deal to pause the war in Gaza.</p><p>But Benny Gantz says Israel is ready to press ahead with its offensive in the southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, despite widespread international opposition.</p><p>Israel is seeking the release of the more than 100 hostages that Hamas is still holding in Gaza. Hamas wants an end to the war, withdrawal of all Israeli troops and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>Weeks of efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have so far not yielded a deal. However Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister, said there are “initial signs that indicate the possibility of moving forward.”</p><p>“We will not stop looking for the way and we will not miss any opportunity to bring the girls and boys home,” he added.</p><p>Israel has identified Rafah, a city on the Egyptian border where over half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge, as its next target. It says Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.</p><p>Gantz said Israel will evacuate the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Rafah before striking, but repeated his pledge that the offensive will take place during Ramadan if hostages are not released.</p><p>“I repeat — if there is no outline for the (hostage) release, we will also operate during Ramadan,” he said.</p><p>The U.S. and other members of the international community have urged Israel not to strike Rafah without a plan to protect civilians.</p><p>Ramadan is expected to begin around March 10.</p><p>GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization says he hasn’t spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a decade and will “probably” make contact now, at a time when Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has devastated medical facilities there.</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when asked about his contact with Netanyahu in recent months, said he had not been in touch with the Israeli leader since he served as Ethiopia’s foreign minister in 2014.</p><p>“So probably I will take that as a recommendation and make contact,” Tedros told a WHO news conference on Wednesday, noting that the organization’s country office has been in contact with Israeli authorities.</p><p>Tedros has made repeated heartfelt statements on how Israel’s war in Gaza has decimated the health sector. However, his comments Wednesday were the first time he publicly said he hasn’t tried talking to Netanyahu about the how the war is being conducted.</p><p>Tedros, who led the U.N. health agency’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, has over the years met with many world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, before the pandemic was declared, and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza have repeatedly come under fire by Israel’s military during the monthslong war. Israel has accused the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, of using medical facilities as cover for its operations.</p><p>WHO has listed a total of 754 “attacks on health care” — including strikes that hit ambulances, medical facilities, health care workers and any other attacks that affect the provision of health care — in occupied Palestinian areas since Oct. 7.</p><p>On Tuesday, WHO said 32 patients in critical condition had been transferred from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to other facilities in recent days, after the complex became “non-functional” following an Israeli siege and military raid.</p><p>“The health and humanitarian situation in Gaza is inhumane and continues to deteriorate,” Tedros said in his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p><p>GENEVA — Switzerland will ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the government said Wednesday.</p><p>Under the ban, Swiss authorities can more easily apply preventative measures to deny entry or expel anyone suspected of affiliation with Hamas, and exchange information with foreign authorities more openly in cases of suspected terrorism financing linked to the group.</p><p>The Federal Council, Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch, said the ban will affect Hamas and any potential successor organizations. The Swiss government already listed Hamas as a terror organization just days after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.</p><p>Acts of support for Hamas could be punishable with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, depending on the level of influence in the group, the government said in a statement. However, the ban so far is limited to five years, but it can be extended by parliament.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s parliament has given overwhelming approval to a declaration expressing opposition to international efforts to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.</p><p>Wednesday’s vote, approved by 99 of 120 lawmakers, is not binding but reflects the widespread sentiment in Israel as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza for a fifth month. Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p><p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p><p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p><p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p><p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p><p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p><p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p><p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p><p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p><p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p><p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p><p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p><p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p><p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p><p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p><p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p><p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p><p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p><p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p><p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>"

When companies roll out more efficient machines or technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost their profits and raise their employees’ pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check.</p>\n<p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has likened surging productivity to “magic beanstalk beans for the economy. … You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.’’</p>\n<p>Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm RSM, said, “The last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s.”</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-robots-and-happy-workers-productivity-surge-helps-explain-us-economys-surprising-resilience\",\"pos\":\"mr2_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>That was when a productivity surge — an early payoff from the sudden embrace of laptops, cellphones and the internet — helped allow the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates low because inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market sizzled.</p>\n<p>This time, the Fed’s aggressive streak of rate hikes — 11 of them starting in March 2022 — has managed to help cool inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1% while causing little economic hardship.</p>\n<p>“I would have said it’s not possible,’’ said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “But that’s exactly what happened.’’</p>\n<p>A year ago, nearly every economist was warning that a recession was all but inevitable.

With unemployment barely above a half-century low, the Fed chair told reporters, “We’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.”</p>\n<p>He did caution that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. Yet the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its 2% goal that it hasn’t raised rates since July and is expected to cut rates multiple times this year.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool &amp; Die have managed to achieve in the past year or so. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed’s 2% target. That would mean that today’s roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Yet higher productivity has changed that equation: There’s now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation.</p>\n<p>“A lot of that pressure on business finances — that normally causes them to raise prices — has been offset by strong productivity growth,’’ Guatieri said.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr4_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-robots-and-happy-workers-productivity-surge-helps-explain-us-economys-surprising-resilience\",\"pos\":\"mr4_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr4_ab-mr4_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr4_ab-mr4_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing steadily even while inflation has tumbled.</p>\n<p>“That’s one way to look at it — yeah,” Powell replied.</p>\n<p>The productivity boom marks a sharp shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged around a tepid 1.5%, according RSM’s calculations. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p>\n<p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging.

Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago. Labor productivity rose at a 3.6% annual pace from last April through June, 4.9% from July through September and 3.2% from October through December.</p>\n<p>At Reata Engineering &amp; Machine Works, “efficiency was kind of forced on us,’’ CEO Grady Cope said. With the job market roaring, the company, based in Englewood, Colorado, couldn’t hire fast enough. Meantime, its customers were starting to balk at paying higher prices.</p>\n<p>So Reata installed robots and other technology to produce more with less. Software allowed it to automate the delivery of price quotes to customers. That process used to require two weeks. Now, it can be done in 24 hours. </p>\n<p>Many economists and business people say they’re hopeful, if not certain, that the productivity boom can continue. Artificial intelligence, they note, is only beginning to penetrate factory floors, warehouses, stores and offices.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr6_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-robots-and-happy-workers-productivity-surge-helps-explain-us-economys-surprising-resilience\",\"pos\":\"mr6_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"news\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr6_ab-mr6_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr6_ab-mr6_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>“Right now, AI is not a critical enabler for us; it’s an assistant and accelerator in certain roles,’’ said Peter Doyle, CEO of Hirsh Precision, which makes parts for the aerospace and medical device industries. “The world is still trying to understand what AI is capable of doing and how quickly it will advance.’’</p>\n<p>The early evidence suggests that AI could sustain the productivity gains. A study last year by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tracked 5,200 customer-support agents at a Fortune 500 company who used a generative AI-based assistant in 2020 and 2021.

Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. Parts shortages arose.</p><p>Desperate, many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago.

Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. Parts shortages arose.</p><p>Desperate, many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago. Labor productivity rose at a 3.6% annual pace from last April through June, 4.9% from July through September and 3.2% from October through December.</p><p>At Reata Engineering &amp; Machine Works, “efficiency was kind of forced on us,’’ CEO Grady Cope said. With the job market roaring, the company, based in Englewood, Colorado, couldn’t hire fast enough. Meantime, its customers were starting to balk at paying higher prices.</p><p>So Reata installed robots and other technology to produce more with less. Software allowed it to automate the delivery of price quotes to customers. That process used to require two weeks.

It wasn’t easy. Attracting factory workers to a community of 7,300 in the Indiana countryside was a tough sell, especially having to compete with big-name manufacturers nearby like Honda and Cummins Engine.</p><p>Job seekers were scarce.</p><p>“You could count on one hand how many people in the town were unemployed,” said Jody Fledderman, the CEO. “It was just crazy.’’</p><p>Batesville Tool &amp; Die managed to fill just 40 of its vacancies.</p><p>Enter the robots. The company invested in machines that could mimic human workers and in vision systems, which helped its robots “see” what they were doing.</p><p>The Batesville experience and others like it have been replicated countlessly across the United States for the past couple of years. Chronic worker shortages have led many companies to invest in machines to do some of the work they can’t find people to do. They’ve also been training the workers they do have to use advanced technology so they can produce more with less.</p><p>The result has been an unexpected productivity boom, which helps explain a great economic mystery: How has the world’s largest economy managed to remain so healthy, with brisk growth and low unemployment, despite brutally high interest rates that are intended to tame inflation but that typically cause a recession? </p><p>To economists, strong productivity growth provides an almost magical elixir. When companies roll out more efficient machines or technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost their profits and raise their employees’ pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check.</p><p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has likened surging productivity to “magic beanstalk beans for the economy. … You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.’’</p><p>Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm RSM, said, “The last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s.”</p><p>That was when a productivity surge — an early payoff from the sudden embrace of laptops, cellphones and the internet — helped allow the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates low because inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market sizzled.</p><p>This time, the Fed’s aggressive streak of rate hikes — 11 of them starting in March 2022 — has managed to help cool inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1% while causing little economic hardship.</p><p>“I would have said it’s not possible,’’ said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “But that’s exactly what happened.’’</p><p>A year ago, nearly every economist was warning that a recession was all but inevitable. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself warned in 2022 that beating inflation would inflict “some pain” in the form of widespread layoffs and higher unemployment.</p><p>By last month, Powell was sounding a different note. With unemployment barely above a half-century low, the Fed chair told reporters, “We’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.”</p><p>He did caution that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. Yet the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its 2% goal that it hasn’t raised rates since July and is expected to cut rates multiple times this year.</p><p>Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool &amp; Die have managed to achieve in the past year or so. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed’s 2% target. That would mean that today’s roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Yet higher productivity has changed that equation: There’s now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation.</p><p>“A lot of that pressure on business finances — that normally causes them to raise prices — has been offset by strong productivity growth,’’ Guatieri said.</p><p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing steadily even while inflation has tumbled.</p><p>“That’s one way to look at it — yeah,” Powell replied.</p><p>The productivity boom marks a sharp shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged around a tepid 1.5%, according RSM’s calculations. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. Parts shortages arose.</p><p>Desperate, many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago. Labor productivity rose at a 3.6% annual pace from last April through June, 4.9% from July through September and 3.2% from October through December.</p><p>At Reata Engineering &amp; Machine Works, “efficiency was kind of forced on us,’’ CEO Grady Cope said. With the job market roaring, the company, based in Englewood, Colorado, couldn’t hire fast enough. Meantime, its customers were starting to balk at paying higher prices.</p><p>So Reata installed robots and other technology to produce more with less. Software allowed it to automate the delivery of price quotes to customers. That process used to require two weeks. Now, it can be done in 24 hours. </p><p>Many economists and business people say they’re hopeful, if not certain, that the productivity boom can continue. Artificial intelligence, they note, is only beginning to penetrate factory floors, warehouses, stores and offices.</p><p>“Right now, AI is not a critical enabler for us; it’s an assistant and accelerator in certain roles,’’ said Peter Doyle, CEO of Hirsh Precision, which makes parts for the aerospace and medical device industries. “The world is still trying to understand what AI is capable of doing and how quickly it will advance.’’</p><p>The early evidence suggests that AI could sustain the productivity gains. A study last year by Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University and Danielle Li and Lindsey Raymond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology tracked 5,200 customer-support agents at a Fortune 500 company who used a generative AI-based assistant in 2020 and 2021. The AI tool provided suggestions for dealing with customers and links to useful internal documents.</p><p>Those using the chatbot were found to be 14% more productive than colleagues who didn’t use the tool. They handled more calls and completed them faster. The biggest gains in productivity — 34% — came from the least-experienced, least-skilled workers.</p><p>Automation tends to raise fears that machines will replace human workers and thereby kill jobs. Some workers supplanted by robots do often struggle to find new work and end up settling for lower pay. </p><p>Yet history suggests that in the long run, technological improvements actually create more jobs than they destroy.

A 1979 biopic, made when Lennon was still alive, called “The Birth of the Beatles” was produced with Beatles original drummer Pete Best as an adviser. The 1994 indie drama “Backbeat” chronicled Lennon’s relationship with Stuart Sutcliffe before the Beatles were famous. “Nowhere Boy” (2009) starred Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a teenage Lennon.</p><p>But in the last decade, music biopics have become big business.

Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday’s primary. </p>\n<p>In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley’s strongest showings and some of Trump’s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections. </p>\n<p>Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous.

Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas.</p>\n<p>These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas.

The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted EPA’s authority to fight air and water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine mandate and blocked President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.</p>\n<p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. </p>\n<p>A lawyer for the EPA said the “good neighbor” rule was important to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states. Besides the potential health impacts, the states face their own federal deadlines to ensure clean air, said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, representing the EPA.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-supreme-court-seems-skeptical-of-epas-good-neighbor-rule-on-power-plant-pollution\",\"pos\":\"mr1_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"national\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news/national\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>States such as Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut can struggle to meet federal standards and reduce harmful levels of ozone because of pollution from power plants, cement kilns and natural gas pipelines that drift across their borders.</p>\n<p>Judith Vale, New York’s deputy solicitor general, said as much as 65% of some states’ smog pollution comes from out of state.</p>\n<p>The EPA plan was intended to provide a national solution to the problem of ozone pollution, but challengers said it relied on the assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would participate. </p>\n<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying the EPA plan could impose unreasonable costs on states that remain under its authority, because it was initially designed for 23 states.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr2_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-supreme-court-seems-skeptical-of-epas-good-neighbor-rule-on-power-plant-pollution\",\"pos\":\"mr2_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"national\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news/national\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr2_ab-mr2_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>“EPA came back and said, ‘Even if we have fewer states, we’re going to plow ahead anyway,”’ Kavanaugh said. “Let’s just kind of pretend nothing happened and just go ahead with the 11 states.”</p>\n<p>The EPA proceeded “without a whole lot of explanation, and nobody got a chance to comment on that” as part of the rule-making process, added Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p>\n<p>“What (states) are asking for is simply an opportunity to make the argument before the agency,″ said Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>\n<p>Stewart responded that requirements for states to control air pollution don’t change based on the number of states subject to the rule. “The requirements are exactly the same,” he said.</p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr3_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-supreme-court-seems-skeptical-of-epas-good-neighbor-rule-on-power-plant-pollution\",\"pos\":\"mr3_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"national\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news/national\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr3_ab-mr3_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr3_ab-mr3_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why the Supreme Court was hearing the case before the other legal challenges were completed.

Police first learned the girl was missing in December 2021 and later said she was killed, though her body was never found.</p>\n<p>In closing arguments, defense attorney Caroline Smith said Montgomery moved the body and hid it because of “a very misguided belief” he had to do so “to keep his family from being ripped apart.” </p>\n<p>But prosecutor Benjamin Agati told jurors a different story. He said Montgomery, 34, was angry that his daughter was having bathroom accidents inside the car they were living in after they were evicted from their home. He said Montgomery punched her in the head until she died. </p>\n<p>“All he has is his car, and his rage, and his fists,” Agati said, later adding, “She doesn’t get a headstone in the ground above the head that he battered. She doesn’t get to be at peace and death because of what he did, because he can’t afford to tell anyone where she is.”</p>\n<p>Harmony’s mother, Crystal Sorey, cried and at times covered her ears as Agati spoke in court. </p>\n<aside class=\"ad-unit ad-unit--mr1_ab\">\n<div class=\"ad-unit__content\">\n<div data-fbonly=\"false\" data-not-refids=\"\" data-refids=\"\" data-slot='{\"is_oop\":false,\"is_companion\":true,\"sizes\":[[[1280,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[1024,0],[[300,250],[620,366]]],[[768,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[641,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]],[[0,0],[[300,250],[325,204],[325,508]]]]}' data-targeting='{\"kw\":\"ap-jury-starts-deliberating-in-trial-of-new-hampshire-man-accused-of-killing-daughter-5\",\"pos\":\"mr1_ab\",\"fold\":\"atf\",\"category\":\"national\"}' data-unit=\"/5678/nx.wbre/news/national\" id=\"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\"></div> <script>     try {         var event = new CustomEvent(\"nsDfpSlotRendered\", {             detail: { id: \"acm-ad-tag-mr1_ab-mr1_ab\" }         });         console.log(\"HTL.nsDfpSlotRendered\", event);         window.dispatchEvent(event);     } catch (err) {}     </script> </div>\n</aside>\n<p>Adam Montgomery is serving a 30-year prison sentence for an unrelated gun conviction and has not attended trial.

He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. </p><p>Montgomery’s attorneys have acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he “purposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed” her corpse and falsified physical evidence.</p><p>Montgomery also faced charges of assaulting his daughter in 2019 — giving her a black eye — and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, who is Harmony’s stepmother.</p><p>Investigators believe Harmony was murdered in December 2019, though she wasn’t reported missing for nearly two years. Kayla Montgomery testified the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had custody of Harmony. Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony was on a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year’s Eve 2021. </p><p>Photos of Harmony were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. She was not given immunity, but acknowledged to defense lawyers that she hasn’t faced further consequences for inconsistencies in her statements to police or prosecutors.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony in the head because the girl had wet herself. She said her family, including the couple’s two young sons, had been evicted and were living in their car. According to Kayla, Adam punched Harmony at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant on the morning of Dec. 7, 2019.</p><p>She also testified about handing food to the children without checking on Harmony, the subsequent discovery that Harmony was dead, and the places her husband hid the body, including in a ceiling vent at a homeless shelter and the walk-in freezer at his workplace. </p><p>Kayla testified her husband drove away with Harmony’s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn’t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021. </p><p> Toll data shows the truck crossed a major bridge in Boston multiple times. Last year, police searched a marshy area in Revere, Massachusetts, without finding Harmony’s body.</p><p>Adam Montgomery’s attorneys said that the only person who knew how Harmony died — Kayla — was lying. They said that Harmony actually died the night before Kayla said she did, and that Kayla was alone with her at the time. </p><p>“She was an instigator and equal partner,” Smith said. “He did not influence her. She influenced him, and most importantly, he did not kill his daughter.”</p><p>But Agati described Kayla as “a battered woman admitting an inconvenient and terrible truth that she failed in a moment of life when her character was put to the test. She did nothing to help Harmony, nothing to stop her. She didn’t kill her. Only the defendant did that.” </p>"

Another vehicle drove off the east bridge abutment and landed on its roof. There were injuries but no one died.</p><p>After investigators presented their findings, three members of the National Transportation Safety Board agreed that poor inspections and insufficient oversight were among the probable causes of the collapse.</p><p>“The Fern Hollow Bridge collapse should never have happened,” NTSB chair Jennifer L. Homendy said, describing the incident as a wake-up call. </p><p>Homendy cited extensive corrosion to the uncoated weathering steel and “repeated failures to act” on damage to the bridge that was known for years. In some areas, the steel had deteriorated to the point of visible holes in the structure.</p><p>“The city of Pittsburgh was responsible for inspecting and maintaining the Fern Hollow bridge,” said NTSB senior structural engineer Dan Walsh. “Similar maintenance and repair recommendations were made in the inspection reports for more than 15 years leading up to the collapse. But the city failed to act on them, resulting in progressive corrosion to the point of failure.”</p><p>The office of Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey said the administration does not dispute the NTSB findings and noted the bridge inspections were performed by consultants. The city has created a new Bridge Maintenance Division and increased funding for bridge maintenance and repairs by 300%.</p><p>Pittsburgh communications director Maria Montaño said in an email that the city has since examined inspection reports for all the bridges it owns “and has been working diligently to address all critical tasks identified in those reports.” She said most “high priority” tasks have been resolved or are in the process, and the city has reviewed all of its bridges’ “fracture critical” components and made sure they are draining properly.</p><p>Four people were injured, two of them severely, when the bridge collapsed just hours before President Joe Biden arrived in Pittsburgh to promote spending on infrastructure. </p><p>Attorney Steve Barth, who represents bus driver Daryl Luciani in litigation against the city and engineers involved with the bridge, said the NTSB findings confirmed what his own experts had concluded.</p><p>Barth said there were “multiple levels of failure, from data collection, recording that data, implementation of any recommendations and then oversight.”</p><p>There are at least six lawsuits involving the bridge collapse, Barth said. Luciani needed shoulder surgery, had back and neck injuries and is dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, Barth said. The accident required Luciani to be out on worker’s compensation for a lengthy period, his lawyer said.</p><p>Montaño declined to comment on the pending litigation.</p><p>The presentations expanded on findings released by the NTSB last May, when investigators said drainage problems led to the deterioration of the structure’s legs and that debris, dirt and leaves had not been cleared.</p><p>The old bridge was about 50 years old when it collapsed and had been under a 26-ton (24,000 kilograms) posted weight limit, with annual inspections required by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation since 2014. Investigators said a more accurate inspection would have reduced that to about 6,000 pounds (2,700 kilos), which may have required its closure. </p><p>The board played an animation of the collapse along with video from the bus, operated by the Port Authority of Allegheny County, now known as Pittsburgh Regional Transit. It showed the harrowing moments when the bridge began to fail and then dropped.</p><p>The failure began when a steel tie-plate on the bridge’s southwestern leg gave way because of corrosion and structural loss, said NTSB senior accident investigator Dennis Collins.

And providers consulted with attorneys.</p><p>Justices — citing language in the Alabama Constitution that the state recognizes the “rights of the unborn child” — said three couples could sue for wrongful death when their frozen embryos were destroyed in a accident at a storage facility.</p><p> “Unborn children are ‘children’ … without exception based on developmental stage, physical location, or any other ancillary characteristics,” Justice Jay Mitchell wrote in Friday’s majority ruling by the all-Republican court. </p><p>Mitchell said the court had previously ruled that a fetus killed when a woman is pregnant is covered under Alabama’s Wrongful Death of a Minor Act and nothing excludes “extrauterine children from the Act’s coverage.”</p><p>The ruling brought a rush of warnings about the potential impact on fertility treatments and the freezing of embryos, which had previously been considered property by the courts. </p><p>Groups representing both IVF treatment providers and patients seeking fertility treatments raised alarm about the decision. </p><p>Barbara Collura, the CEO of RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, told The Associated Press Tuesday that the ruling raises questions for providers and patients, including if they can freeze future embryos created during fertility treatment or if patients could ever donate or destroy unused embryos. </p><p>The Alabama Supreme Court decision partly hinged on anti-abortion language added to the Alabama Constitution in 2018, stating it is the “policy of this state to ensure the protection of the rights of the unborn child.”</p><p>Eric Johnston, an anti-abortion activist and lawyer who helped draft the constitutional language, said the “purpose of that was more related to abortion.” He said it was intended to clarify that the Alabama Constitution does not protect the right to the abortion and eventually laid the groundwork for Alabama to ban abortions when states regained control of abortion access.</p><p>“Modern science has raised up this question about well is a fertilized egg that is frozen — is that a person? And that’s the ethical, medical, legal dilemma that we’ve got right now. … It’s a very complicated issue,” Johnston said.</p><p>However, opponents of the constitutional amendment warned in 2018 that it was essentially a personhood measure that could give rights to fertilized eggs. </p>"

Rochester is much closer to the centerline, and will spend over twice the amount of time in darkness—3 minutes and 40 seconds.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_photo\">\n<div class=\"photo\" data-module=\"photo\">\n<div class=\"photo__image\">\n<div class=\"photo__ratio-enforcer\">\n<div class=\"photo__ratio-enforced\">\n<img class=\"photo__placeholder\" loading=\"eager\" src=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_16x9.jpg\"/>\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"photo__main\" loading=\"eager\" onload=\"this.style.opacity=1\" src=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1140x641.jpg\" srcset=\"https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_16x9.jpg 16w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_140x79.jpg 140w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_360x203.jpg 360w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_540x304.jpg 540w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_750x422.jpg 750w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/WNEP/images/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2/f3878258-fe3d-4b02-94cb-d82a2da866e2_1920x1080.jpg 1920w\" style=\"opacity:0\"/>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"photo__meta\">\n<div class=\"photo__credit\">Credit: Michael Zeiler | GreatAmericanEclipse.com</div>\n<div class=\"photo__caption\">The closer to the centerline of the path of totality, the longer you will experience darkness.</div>\n</div>\n</div> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>Williamsport will be in 96% totality.

Excluding an eclipse only visible in <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2033-march-30\">Alaska in 2033</a>, the next time a total solar eclipse will be visible within in the United States at all will be <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2044-august-23\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 years from now</a>, and the path of totality only inches its way into the Northern Plains (Montana, North &amp; South Dakota).

You can damage your retinas. In order to view a solar eclipse safely, you must use special ISO 12312-2 certified eclipse glasses, which be purchased in stores and online, but be careful of fakes which lack the certification on the inside arm of the paper glasses. Visit the American Astronomical Society website for a <a href=\"https://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/viewers-filters\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">list of reputable solar eclipse viewer and filter vendors</a>.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>Total solar eclipses only happen once every 1 to 2 years, and each traces a unique path along a different part of Earth, often over the ocean or land where there is low population density. For any given point on the planet, the path of totality only aligns <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-eclipse-1973\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on average once every 375 years</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2026-august-12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">next total solar eclipse</a> will take place in Greenland, Iceland, and Spain on August 12, 2026. Excluding an eclipse only visible in <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2033-march-30\">Alaska in 2033</a>, the next time a total solar eclipse will be visible within in the United States at all will be <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2044-august-23\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">20 years from now</a>, and the path of totality only inches its way into the Northern Plains (Montana, North &amp; South Dakota). The <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2045-august-12\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">next total solar eclipse</a> that will streak its way across the entire United States won’t be until 2045.

When World War I ended in 1945, the law instating national daylight saving time was repealed so states could establish their own standard time, according to the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/1779177/daylight-saving-time-once-known-as-war-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense (DOD)</a>.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The lack of rules for daylight saving time led to “confusion for the transportation and broadcast industries,” the DOD said, leading Congress to pass the Uniform Time Act in 1966. The act established a national standard time and daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The dates to “spring” forward and “fall” back have since been changed. In 2005, former President George W. Bush implemented the current policy that extended daylight saving time by several weeks.

How toxic is this victim?'” Fitzgerald said. “I don't know the circumstances of this bite, and it's a horrible case and our sympathies go out to the people, but this is rare.

When World War I ended in 1945, the law instating national daylight saving time was repealed so states could establish their own standard time, according to the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/1779177/daylight-saving-time-once-known-as-war-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense (DOD)</a>.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The lack of rules for daylight saving time led to “confusion for the transportation and broadcast industries,” the DOD said, leading Congress to pass the Uniform Time Act in 1966.

When World War I ended in 1945, the law instating national daylight saving time was repealed so states could establish their own standard time, according to the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/1779177/daylight-saving-time-once-known-as-war-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense (DOD)</a>.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The lack of rules for daylight saving time led to “confusion for the transportation and broadcast industries,” the DOD said, leading Congress to pass the Uniform Time Act in 1966. The act established a national standard time and daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The dates to “spring” forward and “fall” back have since been changed. In 2005, former President George W. Bush implemented the current policy that extended daylight saving time by several weeks. Daylight saving time currently begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.</p> </div>\n<div class=\"article__section article__section_type_text utility__text\">\n<p>The U.S. has also tried permanent daylight saving time before.
