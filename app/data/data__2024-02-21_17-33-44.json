It’s the first Israeli indication of renewed cease-fire talks since negotiations stalled a week ago.</p><p>However, Gantz repeated his pledge that unless Hamas agrees to release the remaining Israeli hostages in Gaza, Israel will launch a ground offensive into the crowded southern city of Rafah during the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan. </p><p>Israel’s war in Gaza has driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes. Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million are packed into Rafah near the border with Egypt.</p><p>Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. About a fourth of some 130 captives still being held are believed to be dead. Israel has laid waste to much of the Palestinian territory in response.

Hamas wants an end to the war, withdrawal of all Israeli troops and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>Weeks of efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have so far not yielded a deal. However Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister, said there are “initial signs that indicate the possibility of moving forward.”</p><p>“We will not stop looking for the way and we will not miss any opportunity to bring the girls and boys home,” he added.</p><p>Israel has identified Rafah, a city on the Egyptian border where over half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge, as its next target. It says Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.</p><p>Gantz said Israel will evacuate the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Rafah before striking, but repeated his pledge that the offensive will take place during Ramadan if hostages are not released.</p><p>“I repeat — if there is no outline for the (hostage) release, we will also operate during Ramadan,” he said.</p><p>The U.S. and other members of the international community have urged Israel not to strike Rafah without a plan to protect civilians.</p><p>Ramadan is expected to begin around March 10.</p><p>GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization says he hasn’t spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a decade and will “probably” make contact now, at a time when Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has devastated medical facilities there.</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when asked about his contact with Netanyahu in recent months, said he had not been in touch with the Israeli leader since he served as Ethiopia’s foreign minister in 2014.</p><p>“So probably I will take that as a recommendation and make contact,” Tedros told a WHO news conference on Wednesday, noting that the organization’s country office has been in contact with Israeli authorities.</p><p>Tedros has made repeated heartfelt statements on how Israel’s war in Gaza has decimated the health sector. However, his comments Wednesday were the first time he publicly said he hasn’t tried talking to Netanyahu about the how the war is being conducted.</p><p>Tedros, who led the U.N. health agency’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, has over the years met with many world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, before the pandemic was declared, and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza have repeatedly come under fire by Israel’s military during the monthslong war. Israel has accused the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, of using medical facilities as cover for its operations.</p><p>WHO has listed a total of 754 “attacks on health care” — including strikes that hit ambulances, medical facilities, health care workers and any other attacks that affect the provision of health care — in occupied Palestinian areas since Oct. 7.</p><p>On Tuesday, WHO said 32 patients in critical condition had been transferred from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to other facilities in recent days, after the complex became “non-functional” following an Israeli siege and military raid.</p><p>“The health and humanitarian situation in Gaza is inhumane and continues to deteriorate,” Tedros said in his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p><p>GENEVA — Switzerland will ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the government said Wednesday.</p><p>Under the ban, Swiss authorities can more easily apply preventative measures to deny entry or expel anyone suspected of affiliation with Hamas, and exchange information with foreign authorities more openly in cases of suspected terrorism financing linked to the group.</p><p>The Federal Council, Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch, said the ban will affect Hamas and any potential successor organizations. The Swiss government already listed Hamas as a terror organization just days after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.</p><p>Acts of support for Hamas could be punishable with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, depending on the level of influence in the group, the government said in a statement. However, the ban so far is limited to five years, but it can be extended by parliament.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s parliament has given overwhelming approval to a declaration expressing opposition to international efforts to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.</p><p>Wednesday’s vote, approved by 99 of 120 lawmakers, is not binding but reflects the widespread sentiment in Israel as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza for a fifth month. Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p><p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p><p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p><p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p><p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p><p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p><p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p><p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p><p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p><p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p><p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p><p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p><p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p><p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p><p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p><p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p><p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p><p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p><p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p><p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>"

Hamas wants an end to the war, withdrawal of all Israeli troops and the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</p><p>Weeks of efforts by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have so far not yielded a deal. However Gantz, a former military chief and defense minister, said there are “initial signs that indicate the possibility of moving forward.”</p><p>“We will not stop looking for the way and we will not miss any opportunity to bring the girls and boys home,” he added.</p><p>Israel has identified Rafah, a city on the Egyptian border where over half of Gaza’s population has sought refuge, as its next target. It says Rafah is the last remaining Hamas stronghold after nearly five months of fighting.</p><p>Gantz said Israel will evacuate the hundreds of thousands of civilians in Rafah before striking, but repeated his pledge that the offensive will take place during Ramadan if hostages are not released.</p><p>“I repeat — if there is no outline for the (hostage) release, we will also operate during Ramadan,” he said.</p><p>The U.S. and other members of the international community have urged Israel not to strike Rafah without a plan to protect civilians.</p><p>Ramadan is expected to begin around March 10.</p><p>GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization says he hasn’t spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a decade and will “probably” make contact now, at a time when Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has devastated medical facilities there.</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when asked about his contact with Netanyahu in recent months, said he had not been in touch with the Israeli leader since he served as Ethiopia’s foreign minister in 2014.</p><p>“So probably I will take that as a recommendation and make contact,” Tedros told a WHO news conference on Wednesday, noting that the organization’s country office has been in contact with Israeli authorities.</p><p>Tedros has made repeated heartfelt statements on how Israel’s war in Gaza has decimated the health sector. However, his comments Wednesday were the first time he publicly said he hasn’t tried talking to Netanyahu about the how the war is being conducted.</p><p>Tedros, who led the U.N. health agency’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, has over the years met with many world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, before the pandemic was declared, and French President Emmanuel Macron.</p><p>Hospitals in Gaza have repeatedly come under fire by Israel’s military during the monthslong war. Israel has accused the militant group Hamas, which runs Gaza, of using medical facilities as cover for its operations.</p><p>WHO has listed a total of 754 “attacks on health care” — including strikes that hit ambulances, medical facilities, health care workers and any other attacks that affect the provision of health care — in occupied Palestinian areas since Oct. 7.</p><p>On Tuesday, WHO said 32 patients in critical condition had been transferred from Nasser Medical Complex in southern Gaza to other facilities in recent days, after the complex became “non-functional” following an Israeli siege and military raid.</p><p>“The health and humanitarian situation in Gaza is inhumane and continues to deteriorate,” Tedros said in his opening remarks on Wednesday.</p><p>GENEVA — Switzerland will ban the Palestinian militant group Hamas, the government said Wednesday.</p><p>Under the ban, Swiss authorities can more easily apply preventative measures to deny entry or expel anyone suspected of affiliation with Hamas, and exchange information with foreign authorities more openly in cases of suspected terrorism financing linked to the group.</p><p>The Federal Council, Switzerland’s seven-member executive branch, said the ban will affect Hamas and any potential successor organizations. The Swiss government already listed Hamas as a terror organization just days after the deadly Oct. 7 attacks in Israel.</p><p>Acts of support for Hamas could be punishable with penalties of up to 20 years in prison, depending on the level of influence in the group, the government said in a statement. However, the ban so far is limited to five years, but it can be extended by parliament.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel’s parliament has given overwhelming approval to a declaration expressing opposition to international efforts to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state.</p><p>Wednesday’s vote, approved by 99 of 120 lawmakers, is not binding but reflects the widespread sentiment in Israel as it battles Hamas militants in Gaza for a fifth month. Only nine lawmakers voted against the measure.</p><p>“Israel outright rejects international edicts regarding a permanent settlement with the Palestinians. The settlement, to the extent that it is reached, will be solely through direct negotiations between the parties, without preconditions,” it says.</p><p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet adopted the declaration earlier in the week.</p><p>Netanyahu went on the offensive after media reports arose last week of a possible roadmap toward establishing a Palestinian state from the U.S. administration and Arab countries. The United States has also said Palestinian statehood is a key element in a broader vision for the normalization of relations between Israel and regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia.</p><p>The international community overwhelmingly supports an independent Palestinian state as part of a future peace agreement. Netanyahu’s government is filled with hard-liners who oppose Palestinian independence.</p><p>TEL AVIV, Israel — The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel says it found evidence of “systematic and intentional” rape and sexual abuse during the Hamas attack on Oct. 7 that ignited the war in Gaza. </p><p>The report said that “in some cases, rape was conducted in front of an audience, such as partners, family, or friends, to increase the pain and humiliation for all present.” Orit Sulitzeanu, the executive director of the association, says that in many cases, the bodies of male and female victims, including their genitals, were severely mutilated.</p><p>The report, published on Wednesday, did not specify the number of cases it had documented or identify any victims, even anonymously. Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p><p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p><p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p><p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p><p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p><p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p><p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press.

Sulitzeanu said such determinations were difficult because many of the victims were killed after being assaulted, and first responders were so overwhelmed by the scale of death and destruction that they did not document signs of sexual abuse.</p><p>The report’s authors said they based their research on confidential and public interviews with officials and first responders, as well as media reports. Sulitzeanu said they also relied on “confidential sources” but declined to say whether they had spoken to victims.</p><p>An Associated Press investigation also found that sexual assault was part of an atrocity-filled rampage by Hamas and other militants who killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took around 250 hostages on Oct. 7. Hamas has rejected allegations that its gunmen committed sexual assault.</p><p>According to the Israeli report, which was submitted to the United Nations and U.N. investigators carrying out a similar investigation, the sexual and gender-based violence occurred in four main places – the Nova music festival, communities near the Gaza border, Israeli military bases that were overrun by Hamas and places where hostages were held in Gaza.</p><p>Sulitzeanu says the purpose of the report was to document how the sexual violence was similar across multiple sites, indicating it was organized and directed by Hamas.</p><p>The association represents multiple rape crisis centers across Israel.</p><p>BEIRUT — Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike on a southern village has killed a woman and her daughter.</p><p>Wednesday’s airstrike on the village of Majdal Zoun came after a series of strikes overnight, including one on Safi Mountain in the Hezbollah stronghold of Apple Province and another near the southern town of Khiam.</p><p>NNA identified the woman killed as Khadija Salman, 40. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity, in line with regulations, identified her 7-year-old daughter, who later succumbed to her wounds, as Amal al-Dur.</p><p>The Iran-backed Hezbollah has been striking at Israeli posts along the border since the Israel-Hamas war broke out following the Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian militants on southern Israel.</p><p>More than 200 people, the vast majority of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in Lebanon since the latest round of violence broke out more than four months ago. The dead include more than 30 civilians.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli strikes across Gaza killed at least 67 Palestinians overnight and into Wednesday, including in areas where civilians have been told to seek refuge.</p><p>The Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah says it received 44 bodies after multiple strikes in central Gaza. Associated Press reporters saw the bodies arriving in ambulances and private vehicles. Relatives held funeral prayers in the hospital courtyard early Wednesday.</p><p>An airstrike on a home in Gaza’s southernmost city of Rafah killed a family of eight, according to Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Abu Youssef al-Najjar hospital. Nasser Abuel-Nour, a university professor; his wife, Nour, a human rights lawyer; their five children and grandchild were all killed in the strike.</p><p>Al-Hams says another two people were killed in a strike on a vehicle in Rafah. At least seven people were killed in strikes in the southern city of Khan Younis, the main focus of Israel’s offensive in recent weeks, and another six were killed in Muwasi, an area Israel had declared a safe zone, the hospital said.</p><p>The war sparked by Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack into Israel has killed over 29,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, and driven some 80% of the population of 2.3 million from their homes.</p><p>Most heeded Israeli orders to flee south and around 1.5 million have crowded into Rafah. Israel has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city as it seeks to destroy Hamas, which is still fighting Israeli forces across the territory.</p><p>RAFAH, Gaza Strip — The aid group Doctors Without Borders says two people were killed when a shelter housing staff in the Gaza Strip was struck during an Israeli operation in an area where Palestinians have been told to seek shelter.</p><p>“While details are still emerging, ambulance crews have now reached the site, where at least two family members of our colleagues have been killed and six people wounded. We are horrified by what has taken place,” the group said Wednesday in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>The attack took place in Muwasi, a sandy, mostly undeveloped strip of land along the coast that has been transformed into a sprawling tent camp with little in the way of basic services.</p><p>Doctors Without Borders, known by the French acronym MSF, did not identify the source of fire. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.</p><p>Israel has continued to carry out strikes in all parts of the territory, and has vowed to expand its ground offensive to the southernmost city of Rafah, adjacent to Muwasi, where hundreds of thousands of people are sheltering.</p><p>The Qatari Foreign Ministry said Hamas has started delivering medication for the approximately 100 hostages held in Gaza, a month after the medications arrived in Gaza. </p><p>Foreign Ministry spokesperson Dr. Majed Al-Ansari said Tuesday evening that Hamas confirmed they had begun to deliver the medications to the hostages in exchange for medicines and humanitarian aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. </p><p>France and Qatar mediated a deal in January for the shipment of medicine for dozens of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The deal was the first agreement between Israel and the militant group since a weeklong cease-fire in November, but there was no evidence that the medications had arrived.</p><p>France said it took months to organize the shipment of the medicines. Qatar, which has long served as a mediator with Hamas, helped broker the deal that will provide three months’ worth of medication for chronic illnesses for 45 of the hostages, as well as other medicine and vitamins.</p><p>The United Nations’ World Food Program announced a pause in food and aid deliveries to northern Gaza on Tuesday after its drivers faced gunfire and violence from desperate residents swarming the trucks.</p><p>The convoys “faced complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order,” according to a statement from the program. WFP had attempted to resume aid deliveries in northern Gaza after a three-week pause following an Israeli strike on an aid convoy. </p><p>In a rare public criticism of Israel, a top U.S. envoy, David Satterfield, said this week that its targeted killings of Gaza police commanders guarding truck convoys have made it “virtually impossible” to distribute the goods safely. </p><p>The WFP said 1 in 6 children under age 2 are acutely malnourished and people are dying of hunger-related causes. </p><p>“In these past two days our teams witnessed unprecedented levels of desperation,” the WFP said.</p><p>Hamas’ government media office described the WFP decision as a “death sentence” for hundreds of thousands of people in northern Gaza. It called on all UN agencies to return and avert “catastrophic consequences of the famine” there.</p><p>Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels are still able to launch attacks in a crucial Red Sea corridor despite a month of U.S.-led airstrikes. </p><p>The rebels claimed more attacks Tuesday night after seriously damaging a ship and apparently downing an American drone worth tens of millions of dollars in recent days. The U.S. shot down 10 bomb-carrying Houthi drones, as well as a cruise missile heading toward a U.S. destroyer over the last day, Central Command said Tuesday. The U.S. military also targeted a Houthi surface-to-air missile launcher and a drone prior to its launch. </p><p>The Houthi have said they aim to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip, even though few of the ships targeted have any direct links to Israel. Their guerrilla-style attacks show the difficulty of suppressing asymmetrical warfare, and the U.S.-led campaign to protect the shipping route has boosted the rebels’ standing in the Arab world.</p><p>So far, no U.S. sailor or pilot has been wounded, but the U.S. continues to lose drones worth tens of millions of dollars and fire off million-dollar cruise missiles to counter the Houthis, who are using far-cheaper weapons that experts believe largely have been supplied by Iran.</p><p>Based off U.S. military’s statements, American and allied forces have destroyed at least 73 missiles before they were launched, as well as 17 drones, 13 bomb-laden drone boats and one underwater explosive drone, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Those figures don’t include the initial Jan. 11 joint U.S.-U.K. strikes that began the monthlong campaign. The American military also has shot down dozens of missiles and drones already airborne as well since November. </p><p>LONDON — Prince William, the heir to the British throne, called Tuesday for an end to fighting in the Gaza Strip as soon as possible, lamenting the “terrible human cost” since the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel and the “desperate need for increased humanitarian support for Gaza.”</p><p>William stopped short of calling for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza as the House of Commons prepares for a vote on that issue on Wednesday. The message, written in white on a black background, was placed under William’s cypher on X, formerly known as Twitter.</p><p>“Sometimes it is only when faced with the sheer scale of human suffering that the importance of permanent peace is brought home,’’ William said.</p><p>William used careful language focused on universal humanity rather than taking sides. The prince plans to meet with aid workers active in the region and, separately, join a discussion at a synagogue with young people of different faiths who are fighting antisemitism.</p><p>“Even in the darkest hour, we must not succumb to the counsel of despair,″ William said. “I continue to cling to the hope that a brighter future can be found and I refuse to give up on that.”</p><p>The U.S. vetoed an Arab-backed U.N. resolution Tuesday demanding an immediate humanitarian cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war in the embattled Gaza Strip.</p><p>The vote in the Security Council reflected wide global support for ending the more than four-month war that started with Hamas’ surprise invasion of southern Israel that killed about 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military response has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants but says the majority are women and children.</p><p>It was the third U.S. veto of a Security Council resolution demanding a cease-fire in Gaza. </p><p>In a surprise move ahead of the vote, the U.S. circulated a rival U.N. Security Council resolution that would support a temporary cease-fire in Gaza linked to the release of all hostages, and call for the lifting of all restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid. Both of these actions “would help to create the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities,” the draft resolution obtained by the AP says.</p><p>U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told several reporters Monday that the Arab-backed resolution is not “an effective mechanism for trying to do the three things that we want to see happen — which is get hostages out, more aid in, and a lengthy pause to this conflict.”</p>"

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Trying to keep up with customer demand, Batesville Tool &amp; Die began seeking 70 people to hire last year. It wasn’t easy. Attracting factory workers to a community of 7,300 in the Indiana countryside was a tough sell, especially having to compete with big-name manufacturers nearby like Honda and Cummins Engine.</p><p>Job seekers were scarce.</p><p>“You could count on one hand how many people in the town were unemployed,” said Jody Fledderman, the CEO. “It was just crazy.’’</p><p>Batesville Tool &amp; Die managed to fill just 40 of its vacancies.</p><p>Enter the robots. The company invested in machines that could mimic human workers and in vision systems, which helped its robots “see” what they were doing.</p><p>The Batesville experience and others like it have been replicated countlessly across the United States for the past couple of years. Chronic worker shortages have led many companies to invest in machines to do some of the work they can’t find people to do. They’ve also been training the workers they do have to use advanced technology so they can produce more with less.</p><p>The result has been an unexpected productivity boom, which helps explain a great economic mystery: How has the world’s largest economy managed to remain so healthy, with brisk growth and low unemployment, despite brutally high interest rates that are intended to tame inflation but that typically cause a recession? </p><p>To economists, strong productivity growth provides an almost magical elixir. When companies roll out more efficient machines or technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost their profits and raise their employees’ pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check.</p><p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has likened surging productivity to “magic beanstalk beans for the economy. … You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.’’</p><p>Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm RSM, said, “The last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s.”</p><p>That was when a productivity surge — an early payoff from the sudden embrace of laptops, cellphones and the internet — helped allow the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates low because inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market sizzled.</p><p>This time, the Fed’s aggressive streak of rate hikes — 11 of them starting in March 2022 — has managed to help cool inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1% while causing little economic hardship.</p><p>“I would have said it’s not possible,’’ said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “But that’s exactly what happened.’’</p><p>A year ago, nearly every economist was warning that a recession was all but inevitable. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself warned in 2022 that beating inflation would inflict “some pain” in the form of widespread layoffs and higher unemployment.</p><p>By last month, Powell was sounding a different note. With unemployment barely above a half-century low, the Fed chair told reporters, “We’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.”</p><p>He did caution that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. Yet the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its 2% goal that it hasn’t raised rates since July and is expected to cut rates multiple times this year.</p><p>Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool &amp; Die have managed to achieve in the past year or so. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed’s 2% target. That would mean that today’s roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Yet higher productivity has changed that equation: There’s now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation.</p><p>“A lot of that pressure on business finances — that normally causes them to raise prices — has been offset by strong productivity growth,’’ Guatieri said.</p><p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing steadily even while inflation has tumbled.</p><p>“That’s one way to look at it — yeah,” Powell replied.</p><p>The productivity boom marks a sharp shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged around a tepid 1.5%, according RSM’s calculations. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging.

When companies roll out more efficient machines or technology, their workers can become more productive: They increase their output per hour. A result is that companies can often boost their profits and raise their employees’ pay without having to jack up prices. Inflation can remain in check.</p><p>Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has likened surging productivity to “magic beanstalk beans for the economy. … You can have faster income increases, faster wage growth, faster GDP without generating inflation.’’</p><p>Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm RSM, said, “The last time we saw anything like this was the late 1990s.”</p><p>That was when a productivity surge — an early payoff from the sudden embrace of laptops, cellphones and the internet — helped allow the Federal Reserve to keep borrowing rates low because inflation remained under control even as the economy and the job market sizzled.</p><p>This time, the Fed’s aggressive streak of rate hikes — 11 of them starting in March 2022 — has managed to help cool inflation from a four-decade high of 9.1% to 3.1% while causing little economic hardship.</p><p>“I would have said it’s not possible,’’ said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “But that’s exactly what happened.’’</p><p>A year ago, nearly every economist was warning that a recession was all but inevitable. Fed Chair Jerome Powell himself warned in 2022 that beating inflation would inflict “some pain” in the form of widespread layoffs and higher unemployment.</p><p>By last month, Powell was sounding a different note. With unemployment barely above a half-century low, the Fed chair told reporters, “We’ve had a very strong labor market, and we’ve had inflation coming down.”</p><p>He did caution that the central bank wants to see further progress in slowing inflation. Yet the Fed is so optimistic that inflation is heading toward its 2% goal that it hasn’t raised rates since July and is expected to cut rates multiple times this year.</p><p>Perhaps the likeliest explanation is the greater efficiencies that companies like Batesville Tool &amp; Die have managed to achieve in the past year or so. Before productivity began its resurgent growth last year, a rule of thumb was that average hourly pay could rise no more than 3.5% annually for inflation to stay within the Fed’s 2% target. That would mean that today’s roughly 4% average annual pay growth would have to shrink. Yet higher productivity has changed that equation: There’s now more leeway for wage growth to stay elevated without igniting inflation.</p><p>“A lot of that pressure on business finances — that normally causes them to raise prices — has been offset by strong productivity growth,’’ Guatieri said.</p><p>At a news conference this month, Powell was asked whether he believed higher productivity helps explain why the economy has kept growing steadily even while inflation has tumbled.</p><p>“That’s one way to look at it — yeah,” Powell replied.</p><p>The productivity boom marks a sharp shift from the pre-pandemic years, when annual productivity growth averaged around a tepid 1.5%, according RSM’s calculations. Everything changed as the economy rocketed out of the 2020 pandemic recession with unexpected vigor, and businesses struggled to re-hire the many workers they had shed.</p><p>The resulting worker shortage sent wages surging. Inflation jumped, too, as factories and ports buckled under the strain of rising consumer orders. Parts shortages arose.</p><p>Desperate, many companies turned to automation. Investment in equipment and in research and development and other forms of intellectual property accelerated. The efficiency payoff began to arrive almost a year ago.

            "article_content": "<p>NEW YORK (AP) — The Beatles are getting the big-screen biopic treatment in not just one film, but a Fab Four of movies that will give each band member their own spotlight — all of which are to be directed by Sam Mendes.</p><p>For the first time, the Beatles, long among the stingiest rights granters, are giving full life and music rights to a movie project. Sony Pictures announced Monday a deal that may dwarf all music biopics that have come before it, with the stories of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr spread out over a quartet of films.</p><p>The films, conceived by Mendes, are expected to roll out theatrically in innovative fashion, with the movies potentially coexisting or intersecting in theaters. Precise release plans will be announced at a later date. Sony is targeting 2027 for their release.</p><p>McCartney, Starr and the families of John Lennon and George Harrison have all signed off on the project through the band’s Apple Corps. Ltd. Sony Music Publishing controls the rights to the majority of Beatles songs.</p><p>“I’m honored to be telling the story of the greatest rock band of all time, and excited to challenge the notion of what constitutes a trip to the movies,” Mendes said in a statement.</p><p>Each film will be from the perspective of a Beatle.</p><p>“We intend this to be a uniquely thrilling, and epic cinematic experience: four films, told from four different perspectives which tell a single story about the most celebrated band of all time,” said producer Pippa Harris. “To have The Beatles’ and Apple Corps’ blessing to do this is an immense privilege.”</p><p>The Beatles’ most famous forays into film were in their early years. Between 1964 and 1970, they appeared in five movies, including “A Hard Day’s Night” (1964) and the animated “Yellow Submarine” (1968). They have, of course, been the subject of many documentaries, most recently <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-arts-and-entertainment-peter-jackson-e81542a42c74446ad837075140777d65\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Jackson’s 2021 “The Beatles: Get Back.”</a></p><p>In 2023, the Beatles reunited with the aid of artificial intelligence in the newly released song <a href=\"https://www.woodtv.com/entertainment-news/the-last-new-beatles-song-now-and-then-will-be-released-this-week/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">“Now and Then.”</a> The recording was made possible by technology used by Jackson on “Get Back,” and featured a music video made by the New Zealand director.</p><p>Attempts to dramatize the Beatles’ story have been more sporadic and less impactful. A 1979 biopic, made when Lennon was still alive, called “The Birth of the Beatles” was produced with Beatles original drummer Pete Best as an adviser. The 1994 indie drama “Backbeat” chronicled Lennon’s relationship with Stuart Sutcliffe before the Beatles were famous. “Nowhere Boy” (2009) starred Aaron Taylor-Johnson as a teenage Lennon.</p><p>But in the last decade, music biopics have become big business. Box-office hits like “Bohemian Rhapsody,”“Rocketman” and “Elvis” have sent Hollywood executives chasing the next jukebox blockbuster. Over Presidents Day weekend, “Bob Marley: One Love,” produced with the Marley estate, was the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/box-office-one-love-marley-madame-web-74831e0cdd39f2ef53f2430ba5fe1377\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">No. 1 movie in theaters.</a> A <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/entertainment-music-arts-and-entertainment-michael-jackson-john-branca-be9c59a54ac91fd426c5aa1d3248dd61\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Jackson biopic</a> is in production.</p><p>“Theatrical movie events today must be culturally seismic. Sam’s daring, large-scale idea is that and then some,” said Tom Rothman, chair and chief executive of Sony Pictures’ Motion Picture Group.</p><p>The combination of Mendes’ team “with the music and the stories of four young men who changed the world, will rock audiences all over the globe,” Rothman said. “We are deeply grateful to all parties and look forward ourselves to breaking some rules with Sam’s uniquely artistic vision.”</p>"

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump and Nikki Haley will face off Saturday in South Carolina’s first-in-the-South Republican presidential primary, the first head-to-head matchup for the last two remaining major candidates since the New Hampshire primary a month ago.</p><p>The contest takes place on Haley’s home turf. She was South Carolina’s governor for six years before stepping down in 2017 to serve as U.N. ambassador when Trump was elected president. Despite her history, Haley faces strong headwinds in a state where Trump has the support of most of the party establishment, has held a substantial lead in recent polls and enjoys high popularity among the conservative base.</p><p>Both candidates have made sharp attacks against the other, with Trump using derisive nicknames for Haley and playing down her work in his Cabinet. Haley has increasingly questioned Trump’s fitness for office, most recently criticizing his comments on Russia and NATO. It is a marked contrast from earlier in the campaign when she and other GOP hopefuls avoided criticizing Trump directly.</p><p>The South Carolina primary is usually an indicator of which candidate will win the Republican presidential nomination. Since the modern version of the state’s primary began in 1980, all but one GOP primary winner has gone on to win the party’s nomination. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.</p><p>A look at what to expect on election night:</p><p>The primary will be held Saturday and polls will close statewide at 7 p.m. EST.</p><p>The ballot will list Ryan Binkley, Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy, David Stuckenberg, and Trump.</p><p>South Carolina has an open primary system, which means any registered voter may participate in any party’s primary. But voters may only participate in one party’s presidential primary, so people who voted in the Democratic primary on Feb. 3 may not vote in the Republican contest.</p><p>Only about 4% of registered voters cast ballots in the Democratic contest, leaving the bulk of the electorate, including any Democrats and independents who favor Haley over Trump and didn’t vote in the earlier contest, eligible to weigh in on the Republican race.</p><p>There are 50 delegates at stake and 29 will be awarded to the winner of the statewide vote. Twenty-one delegates will be allocated according to the vote in each of the state’s seven congressional districts. The top vote-getter in each district will get three delegates from that district. </p><p>The last time Haley won a competitive GOP primary in South Carolina was in 2010, when she was the top vote-getter in a four-way primary and was forced to a runoff, which she won handily. Six years later, Trump won a crowded six-way race in the state’s presidential primary on his way to capturing the White House and becoming the dominant figure in Republican politics.</p><p>Republican electoral politics have changed dramatically since the last time Haley and Trump each faced other Republican candidates in the Palmetto State. Still, their past election results do provide some clues for Saturday’s primary. </p><p>In their last competitive South Carolina primaries, Haley’s strongest showings and some of Trump’s worst were in counties where Democrats perform best in general elections. </p><p>Trump carried 44 of the state’s 46 counties in the 2016 primary, all except Richland and Charleston, the second- and third-most populous. Haley won these counties by wide margins in her 2010 runoff, as did Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 general election. </p><p>Haley’s other strongest areas in 2010 were the relatively small counties of Bamberg, Lee, Marlboro and Orangeburg, all of which Biden carried, as well as Dorchester and Chesterfield, which Biden lost to Trump.</p><p>The results are broadly consistent with Haley’s performances so far in the 2024 presidential primaries. Her strongest showings in Iowa and New Hampshire were in the states’ Democratic-friendly areas and her worst were in Republican-friendly areas.</p><p>These results suggest that Haley’s best chance to win in South Carolina, or for a competitive result, would be to win big in the state’s Democratic areas, especially in vote-rich Charleston and Richland, while staying competitive in the largest county of Greenville and minimizing the margins in heavily Republican areas. Likewise, she would likely need to perform well in votes cast before Election Day, which will be the first votes reported on election night in most counties.</p><p>The Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory.

            "article_content": "<p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A prosecutor said Wednesday that a New Hampshire man accused of killing his 5-year-old daughter treated her like a thing he’d broken and needed to throw away. But his lawyer said he wasn’t guilty of her death though he made terrible decisions to hide and move her body to keep his family together. </p><p>Jurors heard closing arguments before starting deliberations in the two-week trial of Adam Montgomery on a second-degree murder charge in the case of his daughter, Harmony Montgomery. Police first learned the girl was missing in December 2021 and later said she was killed, though her body was never found.</p><p>The jury deliberated for about two hours Wednesday before recessing for the day. </p><p>In closing arguments earlier in the day, defense attorney Caroline Smith said Montgomery moved the body and hid it because of “a very misguided belief” he had to do so “to keep his family from being ripped apart.” </p><p>But prosecutor Benjamin Agati told jurors a different story. He said Montgomery, 34, was angry that his daughter was having bathroom accidents inside the car they were living in after they were evicted from their home. He said Montgomery punched her in the head until she died. </p><p>“All he has is his car, and his rage, and his fists,” Agati said, later adding, “She doesn’t get a headstone in the ground above the head that he battered. She doesn’t get to be at peace and death because of what he did, because he can’t afford to tell anyone where she is.”</p><p>Harmony’s mother, Crystal Sorey, cried and at times covered her ears as Agati spoke in court. </p><p>Adam Montgomery is serving a 30-year prison sentence for an unrelated gun conviction and has not attended trial. He said in court in an unrelated case last year that he loves Harmony “unconditionally” and did not kill her. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. </p><p>Montgomery’s attorneys have acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he “purposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed” her corpse and falsified physical evidence.</p><p>Montgomery also faced charges of assaulting his daughter in 2019 — giving her a black eye — and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, who is Harmony’s stepmother.</p><p>Investigators believe Harmony was murdered in December 2019, though she wasn’t reported missing for nearly two years. Kayla Montgomery testified the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had custody of Harmony. Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony was on a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year’s Eve 2021. </p><p>Photos of Harmony were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. She was not given immunity, but acknowledged to defense lawyers that she hasn’t faced further consequences for inconsistencies in her statements to police or prosecutors.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony in the head because the girl had wet herself. She said her family, including the couple’s two young sons, had been evicted and were living in their car. According to Kayla, Adam punched Harmony at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant on the morning of Dec. 7, 2019.</p><p>She also testified about handing food to the children without checking on Harmony, the subsequent discovery that Harmony was dead, and the places her husband hid the body, including in a ceiling vent at a homeless shelter and the walk-in freezer at his workplace. </p><p>Kayla testified her husband drove away with Harmony’s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn’t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said.

            "article_content": "<p>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — A prosecutor said Wednesday that a New Hampshire man accused of killing his 5-year-old daughter treated her like a thing he’d broken and needed to throw away. But his lawyer said he wasn’t guilty of her death though he made terrible decisions to hide and move her body to keep his family together. </p><p>Jurors heard closing arguments before starting deliberations in the two-week trial of Adam Montgomery on a second-degree murder charge in the case of his daughter, Harmony Montgomery. Police first learned the girl was missing in December 2021 and later said she was killed, though her body was never found.</p><p>The jury deliberated for about two hours Wednesday before recessing for the day. </p><p>In closing arguments earlier in the day, defense attorney Caroline Smith said Montgomery moved the body and hid it because of “a very misguided belief” he had to do so “to keep his family from being ripped apart.” </p><p>But prosecutor Benjamin Agati told jurors a different story. He said Montgomery, 34, was angry that his daughter was having bathroom accidents inside the car they were living in after they were evicted from their home. He said Montgomery punched her in the head until she died. </p><p>“All he has is his car, and his rage, and his fists,” Agati said, later adding, “She doesn’t get a headstone in the ground above the head that he battered. She doesn’t get to be at peace and death because of what he did, because he can’t afford to tell anyone where she is.”</p><p>Harmony’s mother, Crystal Sorey, cried and at times covered her ears as Agati spoke in court. </p><p>Adam Montgomery is serving a 30-year prison sentence for an unrelated gun conviction and has not attended trial. He said in court in an unrelated case last year that he loves Harmony “unconditionally” and did not kill her. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. </p><p>Montgomery’s attorneys have acknowledged his guilt on two lesser charges, that he “purposely and unlawfully removed, concealed or destroyed” her corpse and falsified physical evidence.</p><p>Montgomery also faced charges of assaulting his daughter in 2019 — giving her a black eye — and of tampering with the key prosecution witness, his estranged wife, Kayla Montgomery, who is Harmony’s stepmother.</p><p>Investigators believe Harmony was murdered in December 2019, though she wasn’t reported missing for nearly two years. Kayla Montgomery testified the body was hidden in the trunk of a car, a cooler, a ceiling vent, and a workplace freezer before Adam disposed of it.</p><p>Adam Montgomery had custody of Harmony. Sorey, who was no longer in a relationship with him, said the last time she saw Harmony was on a video call in April 2019. She eventually went to police, who announced they were looking for the missing child on New Year’s Eve 2021. </p><p>Photos of Harmony were widely circulated on social media. Police eventually determined she had been killed.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery is serving an 18-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to perjury for lying during grand jury testimony about where she was when Harmony was last seen. She was not given immunity, but acknowledged to defense lawyers that she hasn’t faced further consequences for inconsistencies in her statements to police or prosecutors.</p><p>Kayla Montgomery testified that her husband repeatedly punched Harmony in the head because the girl had wet herself. She said her family, including the couple’s two young sons, had been evicted and were living in their car. According to Kayla, Adam punched Harmony at several stop lights as they drove from a methadone clinic to a fast food restaurant on the morning of Dec. 7, 2019.</p><p>She also testified about handing food to the children without checking on Harmony, the subsequent discovery that Harmony was dead, and the places her husband hid the body, including in a ceiling vent at a homeless shelter and the walk-in freezer at his workplace. </p><p>Kayla testified her husband drove away with Harmony’s remains in a rental truck in March 2020, and that he didn’t say where he was going. Not long after that, he started to suspect she might go to the police, so he began punching her, giving her black eyes, she said. She eventually ran away from him in March 2021. </p><p> Toll data shows the truck crossed a major bridge in Boston multiple times. Last year, police searched a marshy area in Revere, Massachusetts, without finding Harmony’s body.</p><p>Adam Montgomery’s attorneys said that the only person who knew how Harmony died — Kayla — was lying.

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed skeptical Wednesday as a government lawyer argued that the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to continue enforcing its anti-air-pollution “good neighbor” rule in 11 states while separate legal challenges continue around the country.</p><p>The rule is intended to restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution.</p><p>Three energy-producing states — Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia — challenged the rule, along with the steel industry and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges.</p><p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted EPA’s authority to fight air and water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine mandate and blocked President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.</p><p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. </p><p>A lawyer for the EPA said the “good neighbor” rule was important to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states. Besides the potential health impacts, the states face their own federal deadlines to ensure clean air, said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, representing the EPA.</p><p>States such as Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut can struggle to meet federal standards and reduce harmful levels of ozone because of pollution from power plants, cement kilns and natural gas pipelines that drift across their borders.</p><p>Judith Vale, New York’s deputy solicitor general, said as much as 65% of some states’ smog pollution comes from out of state.</p><p>The EPA plan was intended to provide a national solution to the problem of ozone pollution, but challengers said it relied on the assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would participate. </p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying the EPA plan could impose unreasonable costs on states that remain under its authority, because it was initially designed for 23 states.</p><p>“EPA came back and said, ‘Even if we have fewer states, we’re going to plow ahead anyway,”’ Kavanaugh said. “Let’s just kind of pretend nothing happened and just go ahead with the 11 states.”</p><p>The EPA proceeded “without a whole lot of explanation, and nobody got a chance to comment on that” as part of the rule-making process, added Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p><p>“What (states) are asking for is simply an opportunity to make the argument before the agency,″ said Chief Justice John Roberts.</p><p>Stewart responded that requirements for states to control air pollution don’t change based on the number of states subject to the rule. “The requirements are exactly the same,” he said.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why the Supreme Court was hearing the case before the other legal challenges were completed. A lawyer for industry groups challenging the rule said it imposes significant and immediate costs that could affect the reliability of the electric grid.</p><p>“There are hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, in costs over the next 12 to 18 months,” with only a small reduction in air pollution and no guarantee the final rule will be upheld, said industry lawyer Catherine Stetson. “There are over-control issues here,” she said.</p><p>The EPA has said power-plant emissions dropped by 18% in 2023 in the 10 states where it has been allowed to enforce its rule, which was finalized last March. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. In California, limits on emissions from industrial sources other than power plants are supposed to take effect in 2026.</p><p>The rule is on hold in another dozen states because of separate legal challenges. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.</p><p>States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites don’t add significantly to air pollution in other states. In cases where a state has not submitted a “good neighbor” plan — or where EPA disapproves a state plan — the federal plan was supposed to ensure that downwind states are protected.</p><p>Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Environmental and public health advocates have praised the EPA plan as a life-saving measure for people who live hundreds of miles away from power plants, cement factories, steel mills and other industrial polluters.</p><p>Industry groups criticize it as having an anti-coal bias that would drive up the cost of electricity.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this story.</p>"

            "article_content": "<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court’s conservative majority seemed skeptical Wednesday as a government lawyer argued that the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to continue enforcing its anti-air-pollution “good neighbor” rule in 11 states while separate legal challenges continue around the country.</p><p>The rule is intended to restrict smokestack emissions from power plants and other industrial sources that burden downwind areas with smog-causing pollution.</p><p>Three energy-producing states — Ohio, Indiana and West Virginia — challenged the rule, along with the steel industry and other groups, calling it costly and ineffective. The rule is on hold in a dozen states because of the court challenges.</p><p>The Supreme Court, with a 6-3 conservative majority, has increasingly reined in the powers of federal agencies, including the EPA, in recent years. The justices have restricted EPA’s authority to fight air and water pollution — including a landmark 2022 ruling that limited EPA’s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that contribute to global warming. The court also shot down a vaccine mandate and blocked President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness program.</p><p>The court is currently weighing whether to overturn its 40-year-old Chevron decision, which has been the basis for upholding a wide range of regulations on public health, workplace safety and consumer protections. </p><p>A lawyer for the EPA said the “good neighbor” rule was important to protect downwind states that receive unwanted air pollution from other states. Besides the potential health impacts, the states face their own federal deadlines to ensure clean air, said Deputy U.S. Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart, representing the EPA.</p><p>States such as Wisconsin, New York and Connecticut can struggle to meet federal standards and reduce harmful levels of ozone because of pollution from power plants, cement kilns and natural gas pipelines that drift across their borders.</p><p>Judith Vale, New York’s deputy solicitor general, said as much as 65% of some states’ smog pollution comes from out of state.</p><p>The EPA plan was intended to provide a national solution to the problem of ozone pollution, but challengers said it relied on the assumption that all 23 states targeted by the rule would participate. </p><p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh seemed sympathetic to that argument, saying the EPA plan could impose unreasonable costs on states that remain under its authority, because it was initially designed for 23 states.</p><p>“EPA came back and said, ‘Even if we have fewer states, we’re going to plow ahead anyway,”’ Kavanaugh said. “Let’s just kind of pretend nothing happened and just go ahead with the 11 states.”</p><p>The EPA proceeded “without a whole lot of explanation, and nobody got a chance to comment on that” as part of the rule-making process, added Justice Neil Gorsuch.</p><p>“What (states) are asking for is simply an opportunity to make the argument before the agency,″ said Chief Justice John Roberts.</p><p>Stewart responded that requirements for states to control air pollution don’t change based on the number of states subject to the rule. “The requirements are exactly the same,” he said.</p><p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson questioned why the Supreme Court was hearing the case before the other legal challenges were completed. A lawyer for industry groups challenging the rule said it imposes significant and immediate costs that could affect the reliability of the electric grid.</p><p>“There are hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, in costs over the next 12 to 18 months,” with only a small reduction in air pollution and no guarantee the final rule will be upheld, said industry lawyer Catherine Stetson. “There are over-control issues here,” she said.</p><p>The EPA has said power-plant emissions dropped by 18% in 2023 in the 10 states where it has been allowed to enforce its rule, which was finalized last March. Those states are Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. In California, limits on emissions from industrial sources other than power plants are supposed to take effect in 2026.</p><p>The rule is on hold in another dozen states because of separate legal challenges. The states are Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.</p><p>States that contribute to ground-level ozone, or smog, are required to submit plans ensuring that coal-fired power plants and other industrial sites don’t add significantly to air pollution in other states. In cases where a state has not submitted a “good neighbor” plan — or where EPA disapproves a state plan — the federal plan was supposed to ensure that downwind states are protected.</p><p>Ground-level ozone, which forms when industrial pollutants chemically react in the presence of sunlight, can cause respiratory problems, including asthma and chronic bronchitis. People with compromised immune systems, the elderly and children playing outdoors are particularly vulnerable.</p><p>Environmental and public health advocates have praised the EPA plan as a life-saving measure for people who live hundreds of miles away from power plants, cement factories, steel mills and other industrial polluters.</p><p>Industry groups criticize it as having an anti-coal bias that would drive up the cost of electricity.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writer Mark Sherman contributed to this story.</p>"

Instead, they have been focused on legislation that would ban private organizations from providing money to election offices.</p><p>“Americans deserve to have confidence in our elections, which means elections should be free from undue private influence,” U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the Committee on House Administration, said at a recent hearing.</p><p>A $75 million Senate proposal for election security is being negotiated as part of the final spending package.</p><p>“Administering free and fair elections is year-round work that takes planning and resources, and election officials on the front lines of our democracy need a steady stream of funding so that they can do things like replace aging equipment, strengthen cybersecurity, and keep pace with new technology,” U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said in a statement.</p><p>In North Carolina, state election officials have had to make some tough decisions as the needs have outpaced state and federal funding.</p><p>North Carolina’s State Board of Elections has reduced its cybersecurity staff by one employee and has been forced to cut back in other areas to meet some of the needs for election security, said Karen Brinson Bell, the agency’s executive director. A team of six employees that had been handling election data has been reduced to just one full-time position, with another person helping part-time. Some eliminated positions were funded by federal grants that are no longer available.</p><p>“Every effort we’ve put forward for cybersecurity has come through federal funding, and without that continuous funding and no new funding through the (North Carolina) legislature, it’s hard to sustain a strong cyber posture,” Brinson Bell said.</p><p>During its recent meeting, the National Association of Secretaries of State passed a resolution calling on Congress to provide sufficient money to help officials address cybersecurity threats.</p><p>West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican, said he does not support federal money for elections because “typically, it comes with strings attached.”</p><p>Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, also a Republican, said he would welcome federal assistance for cybersecurity needs if there was flexibility on how states spent it.</p><p>“I don’t necessarily mind a partnership there with some funding, as long as states are the ones that have the ability to spend those dollars — because what happens in Mississippi may be a little bit different than Minnesota or Maine or California,” Watson said.</p><p>Kim Wyman, the former secretary of state in Washington, said federal officials should heed the lessons of the 2000 election — when some election offices were well-funded and others less so. She said the Help America Vote Act of 2002, approved by Congress in the aftermath of the ballot confusion in Florida, leveled the playing field with $3.2 billion in federal money going to the states. A similar investment is needed now, she said.</p><p>Wisconsin election officials have used previous federal money to provide grants to local election offices that have helped them boost their technology support and training. They also have been able to buy new voting equipment and mail ballot envelopes, said Meagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission.</p><p>New Mexico has used federal money to help cover the costs of its election security program. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, said election officials need predictability.</p><p>“When we create programs, we want to be able to sustain those programs, not just for a year or for two years. We want to sustain them for the long term,” she said.</p><p>In Minnesota, the state has used federal money to create grants for local election officials for voting system upgrades, including electronic pollbooks and tabulators. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said he was concerned about the lack of federal funding and the message that sends about the nation’s priorities.</p><p>“Nobody I know is looking for Congress to fund state elections,” said Simon, a Democrat. “What we are looking for – for election security and other purposes — is for them to be a partner in helping us to fill some gaps.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

A team of six employees that had been handling election data has been reduced to just one full-time position, with another person helping part-time. Some eliminated positions were funded by federal grants that are no longer available.</p><p>“Every effort we’ve put forward for cybersecurity has come through federal funding, and without that continuous funding and no new funding through the (North Carolina) legislature, it’s hard to sustain a strong cyber posture,” Brinson Bell said.</p><p>During its recent meeting, the National Association of Secretaries of State passed a resolution calling on Congress to provide sufficient money to help officials address cybersecurity threats.</p><p>West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner, a Republican, said he does not support federal money for elections because “typically, it comes with strings attached.”</p><p>Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, also a Republican, said he would welcome federal assistance for cybersecurity needs if there was flexibility on how states spent it.</p><p>“I don’t necessarily mind a partnership there with some funding, as long as states are the ones that have the ability to spend those dollars — because what happens in Mississippi may be a little bit different than Minnesota or Maine or California,” Watson said.</p><p>Kim Wyman, the former secretary of state in Washington, said federal officials should heed the lessons of the 2000 election — when some election offices were well-funded and others less so. She said the Help America Vote Act of 2002, approved by Congress in the aftermath of the ballot confusion in Florida, leveled the playing field with $3.2 billion in federal money going to the states. A similar investment is needed now, she said.</p><p>Wisconsin election officials have used previous federal money to provide grants to local election offices that have helped them boost their technology support and training. They also have been able to buy new voting equipment and mail ballot envelopes, said Meagan Wolfe, the nonpartisan administrator of the Wisconsin Elections Commission.</p><p>New Mexico has used federal money to help cover the costs of its election security program. Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver, a Democrat, said election officials need predictability.</p><p>“When we create programs, we want to be able to sustain those programs, not just for a year or for two years. We want to sustain them for the long term,” she said.</p><p>In Minnesota, the state has used federal money to create grants for local election officials for voting system upgrades, including electronic pollbooks and tabulators. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon said he was concerned about the lack of federal funding and the message that sends about the nation’s priorities.</p><p>“Nobody I know is looking for Congress to fund state elections,” said Simon, a Democrat. “What we are looking for – for election security and other purposes — is for them to be a partner in helping us to fill some gaps.”</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press writers Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

            "article_content": "<p>SCRANTON, Pa. — We are exactly 2 months out from the spectacle of a lifetime: a total solar eclipse! On April 8th, the Sun, Moon, and Earth will align in a complete cosmic calibration. As the moon moves between the Sun and Earth, it will cast a shadow on a vast part of Earth's Western Hemisphere, including the entire U.S. </p><p>All 50 states will see at least a <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/why-partial-eclipses-are-worth-seeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partial eclipse</a>, when the sun appears as a crescent shape or as if the moon has \"taken a bite out of the sun.\" An estimated <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">652 million people</a> live in an area that will be able to see the partial eclipse.</p><p>Along a narrow <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~100 mile long strip of land</a> stretching from Mexico, northeast through Texas, Illinois, and all the way up to Maine and Newfoundland, the moon will completely cover the sun. </p><p>Here, revelers will experience totality, and will stand fully within the Moon's <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4517/#:~:text=The%20lunar%20umbra%20is%20the,experience%20a%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>umbra</em></a>, or inner shadow. Many large U.S. cities will be plunged into darkness during the middle of the day. San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Montréal, and Burlington (VT), all fall along the path of totality. Here in our area, the closest cities on that path of totality are Erie, Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse. Only 0.5% of the world's population, or <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/dhs/solar-eclipse-2024/faqs/#:~:text=Although%20the%20sky%20will%20darken,April%202024%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">43 million people</a> (including populations from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), are lucky enough to live along this path.</p><p>During totality, clouds permitting, you will be able to witness a gaping \"hole\" in the sky (the moon covering the sun), a white halo around the sun called the <em>corona</em>, or the sun’s outer atmosphere, a 360° panoramic sunset, and planets and stars become visible in the middle of the day. Since we are <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-maximum-expected-2024-new-predictions-suggest\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approaching a solar maximum</a>, based upon the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased number of sunspots on the surface of the sun</a>, the corona will likely appear bright, sharp, and pointed, whereas during the 2017 Great American Total Solar Eclipse, the sun was far from the peak of its activity cycle, and the corona appeared thin and wispy. </p><p>If skies remain cloudy during totality, it may still be possible to witness the corona, if the clouds are thin enough. If the cloud deck is too thick, you will not be able to see the eclipsed sun, but you will still experience several other environmental changes. </p><p>During totality, regardless of clouds, temperature drops as we cover our light source, <a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/temperature-change-during-totality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes as much as 10-20°</a>. Animals and insects act strange in the moments leading up to, during, and following totality. Birds swarm and squawk in the minutes before totality, and fall silent during the darkness. Bees return to the hive, cows go back to the barn, chickens roost, and fish come up to the surface. During an eclipse, some people even act peculiar: there are reports of some bursting out into tears as they feel an enormous sense of overwhelming emotions during totality.</p><p>In the moments immediately preceding and following totality, some fascinating optical phenomena can occur. Since the moon is not a perfect sphere, right before totality, the last few rays of light pass through the deep valleys on its surface.

            "article_content": "<p>SCRANTON, Pa. — We are exactly 2 months out from the spectacle of a lifetime: a total solar eclipse! On April 8th, the Sun, Moon, and Earth will align in a complete cosmic calibration. As the moon moves between the Sun and Earth, it will cast a shadow on a vast part of Earth's Western Hemisphere, including the entire U.S. </p><p>All 50 states will see at least a <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/articles/why-partial-eclipses-are-worth-seeing\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">partial eclipse</a>, when the sun appears as a crescent shape or as if the moon has \"taken a bite out of the sun.\" An estimated <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/solar/2024-april-8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">652 million people</a> live in an area that will be able to see the partial eclipse.</p><p>Along a narrow <a href=\"https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">~100 mile long strip of land</a> stretching from Mexico, northeast through Texas, Illinois, and all the way up to Maine and Newfoundland, the moon will completely cover the sun. </p><p>Here, revelers will experience totality, and will stand fully within the Moon's <a href=\"https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4517/#:~:text=The%20lunar%20umbra%20is%20the,experience%20a%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>umbra</em></a>, or inner shadow. Many large U.S. cities will be plunged into darkness during the middle of the day. San Antonio, Austin, Dallas, Little Rock, Indianapolis, Cleveland, Montréal, and Burlington (VT), all fall along the path of totality. Here in our area, the closest cities on that path of totality are Erie, Rochester, Buffalo, and Syracuse. Only 0.5% of the world's population, or <a href=\"https://www.in.gov/dhs/solar-eclipse-2024/faqs/#:~:text=Although%20the%20sky%20will%20darken,April%202024%20total%20solar%20eclipse.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">43 million people</a> (including populations from the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), are lucky enough to live along this path.</p><p>During totality, clouds permitting, you will be able to witness a gaping \"hole\" in the sky (the moon covering the sun), a white halo around the sun called the <em>corona</em>, or the sun’s outer atmosphere, a 360° panoramic sunset, and planets and stars become visible in the middle of the day. Since we are <a href=\"https://www.space.com/solar-maximum-expected-2024-new-predictions-suggest\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">approaching a solar maximum</a>, based upon the <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/fsd/sunspots\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">increased number of sunspots on the surface of the sun</a>, the corona will likely appear bright, sharp, and pointed, whereas during the 2017 Great American Total Solar Eclipse, the sun was far from the peak of its activity cycle, and the corona appeared thin and wispy. </p><p>If skies remain cloudy during totality, it may still be possible to witness the corona, if the clouds are thin enough. If the cloud deck is too thick, you will not be able to see the eclipsed sun, but you will still experience several other environmental changes. </p><p>During totality, regardless of clouds, temperature drops as we cover our light source, <a href=\"https://eclipse2017.nasa.gov/temperature-change-during-totality\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sometimes as much as 10-20°</a>. Animals and insects act strange in the moments leading up to, during, and following totality. Birds swarm and squawk in the minutes before totality, and fall silent during the darkness. Bees return to the hive, cows go back to the barn, chickens roost, and fish come up to the surface. During an eclipse, some people even act peculiar: there are reports of some bursting out into tears as they feel an enormous sense of overwhelming emotions during totality.</p><p>In the moments immediately preceding and following totality, some fascinating optical phenomena can occur. Since the moon is not a perfect sphere, right before totality, the last few rays of light pass through the deep valleys on its surface. The result is a string of glowing \"beads\" of light called <a href=\"https://earthsky.org/space/this-date-in-science-bailys-beads-discovered/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baily's Beads</em></a>, which disappear one by one as those valleys cover the sun.

They dug out their cards, and a lot of stuff really shot up in value.\"</p><p>That same 2022 <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshwilson/2022/11/18/sports-fans-are-finding-a-new-way-to-profit-from-the-game-they-love-as-sports-card-investing-explodes/amp/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Forbes</a> article notes a record sale of a 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle rookie card that set the mark at $12.6 million.</p><p>That mark still stands today, but, it stands to reason it could be broken in the future.</p><p>Thoman attributes the growth to a real interest in sports.</p><p>\"I think a lot of it's just everyone [is] interested in sports, and they want a piece of their favorite athlete or favorite team. So, you have some hardcore fans that their local team, they're collecting, whether its Steelers, Cowboys, Eagles, whatever -- they just want a piece of their team,\" Thoman explained.</p><p>No industry is without change, and on the horizon in 2026 could be a big one for the card industry, as online sportswear retailer Fanatics will enter the fray with exclusive 20-year deals with the MLB, NFL, and NBA.</p><p>\"So, they're gonna have a lock for everything, and they're going to kind of control the market a lot here come 2026,\" Thoman said of Fanatics.</p><p>While it's unclear the exact effect that will have on the market, Thoman believes one thing is clear.</p><p>\"When I was a kid, it was .50 cents a pack. There's no such thing as a .50-cent pack anymore. Topps just came out -- it's five bucks a pack. They kind of forgot about the kids, I feel like.

The same name has also been falsely linked to recent incidents in other areas and there’s no evidence anyone with that name even exists. </p><p>Two adults have been charged with murder in connection with the Kansas City parade shooting. But neither of the adults’ names are Sahil Omar. </p><p>The name Sahil Omar has been falsely linked to incidents in other cities, including a school shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, and an explosion in Fort Worth, Texas.

The information surrounding a man named Sahil Omar did not come from us,” a police spokesperson said.</p><p>Several of the viral posts share a photo of a man who they falsely claim is Sahil Omar, a 44-year-old immigrant living illegally in the U.S.</p><p>Using a reverse image search tool called RevEye, VERIFY found the original photo <a href=\"https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/person-is-detained-by-police-near-the-kansas-city-chiefs-news-photo/2003719063\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">on the Getty Images website</a>.

States are allowed to exempt themselves from daylight saving time, meaning they stay in standard time for the full year.</p><p>In the last five years, 19 states have enacted legislation or passed resolutions in support of year-round daylight saving time, the NCSL says.

The act established a national standard time and daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October.</p><p>The dates to “spring” forward and “fall” back have since been changed. In 2005, former President George W. Bush implemented the current policy that extended daylight saving time by several weeks. Daylight saving time currently begins on the second Sunday in March and ends on the first Sunday in November.</p><p>The U.S. has also tried permanent daylight saving time before. In December 1973, <a href=\"https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/statement-signing-the-emergency-daylight-saving-time-energy-conservation-act-1973\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">former President Richard Nixon signed</a> the Emergency Daylight Saving Time Energy Conservation Act, which placed the country on daylight saving time beginning Jan. 6, 1974.

According to the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-provide-debt-relief-and-support-for-student-loan-borrowers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">White House</a>, SAVE is designed to reduce borrowers’ monthly payments by half, allow many borrowers to make $0 monthly payments, and ensure borrowers don’t see their balances grow from unpaid interest.</p><p>The Biden administration first began working on the SAVE plan through a rulemaking process in the fall and winter of 2021, the <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/31149/ED_Releases_Final_Rule_on_Latest_Income-Driven_Repayment_Plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA)</a> says.

The Supreme Court has since struck down the debt forgiveness plan, but SAVE has not faced the same legal challenges.</p><p><strong><a href=\"/email\" id=\"isPasted\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Sign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts daily Newsletter!</em></strong></a></strong><br/><br/></p><p>   </p><p>Most student borrowers have loans that can be repaid through a SAVE plan, but there are some borrowers who do not have eligible loans, the <a href=\"https://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org/save-a-new-payment-plan-that-will-reduce-monthly-payments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Consumer Law Center (NCLC)</a> says. That’s because SAVE only covers federal direct loans.</p><p>These are the same loans currently covered by REPAYE plans, the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#eligible-loans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a> says. So if you’re on a REPAYE plan, your loans will be eligible for SAVE and transferred over to the new plan.</p><p>However, private loans, Parent PLUS loans and other unconsolidated federal loans, such as FFEL loans, Stafford loans and Perkins loans, cannot be paid off with SAVE plans. The National Consumer Law Center says FFEL, Stafford and Perkins loans can be turned into direct consolidation loans, which could then be paid off with a SAVE plan.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a> says borrowers who consolidate their loans will not lose progress toward forgiveness, starting in July 2024.<br/><br/></p><p>Borrowers who sign up or are already signed up for a REPAYE plan will be automatically enrolled in SAVE, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/06/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-new-actions-to-provide-debt-relief-and-support-for-student-loan-borrowers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">White House</a> says. But REPAYE is just one of <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">four different IDR plans</a>, and you’ll have to make the switch yourself if you’re on any of the other three plans, the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a> says.</p><p>Anyone who isn’t on REPAYE or hasn’t already applied for REPAYE or SAVE will have to fill out an application on the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/idr/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Federal Student Aid website</a>. If you’re switching repayment plans, it may take a few weeks for the change to take effect.</p><p>If you’re unsure what payment plan you have, you can check by logging onto StudentAid.gov and checking your <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/aid-summary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">My Aid page</a>. Each loan listed on the page should have a repayment plan listed.<br/><br/></p><p>   </p><p>The SAVE plan is designed to be the go-to IDR plan for most student borrowers going forward.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2021/nfridrriapra.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">regulation which establishes SAVE</a> is worded as revisions to the preexisting REPAYE plan, a plan that is available for new borrowers every year. </p><p>New student borrowers entering repayment will only have the option of enrolling in the standard 10-year repayment plan, the SAVE plan or another program called the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan, <a href=\"https://www.nasfaa.org/news-item/31149/ED_Releases_Final_Rule_on_Latest_Income-Driven_Repayment_Plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NASFAA</a> says.</p><p>That will mean SAVE and IBR will be the only two IDR plans going forward. The Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) plan will be sunsetted as of July 1, 2024, NASFAA says. Once they’re sunsetted, only borrowers currently enrolled in those plans will be permitted to remain on them.</p><p>The IBR plan has a couple of differences from SAVE that might make it more appealing to certain borrowers. Unconsolidated Stafford loans and FFEL loans are <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#eligible-loans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eligible for IBR</a>, and borrowers with graduate loans who are on IBR plans can have their <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven#repayment-period\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">loans forgiven after 20 years</a>, the Education Department says. People with graduate loans have to make payments for 25 years before their loans are forgiven with SAVE.<br/><br/></p><p>   </p><p>SAVE offers lower monthly payments than other IDR plans, the <a href=\"https://www.studentloanborrowerassistance.org/save-a-new-payment-plan-that-will-reduce-monthly-payments/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">NCLC</a> says. But IDR plans do not offer the lowest monthly payment for every borrower, or save every borrower the most money long-term.</p><p>In an IDR plan, you’re generally billed a percentage of your discretionary income — that’s the difference between your income and an amount the Department of Education determines you need to meet your basic needs, the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Education Department</a> says. That amount is normally 150% of the federal poverty line, but it’s <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/save-plan\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">225% of the federal poverty line for SAVE</a>. In other words, SAVE’s formula lets participants keep more of their paycheck for non-loan expenses. </p><p>If your income is lower, an IDR plan requires you to pay less each month. And if your income is below that discretionary income threshold, you pay nothing. For example, a single person making $32,800 annually will not be required to make monthly payments on their student debt if they’re on the SAVE plan.</p><p>But because IDR plans like SAVE bill you based on your income instead of how much you owe, people with higher incomes are charged higher bills. These bills are sometimes higher than those for the <a href=\"https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">standard repayment plan</a>, which calculates your installments based on a 10-year repayment window.</p><p>Additionally, as long as you make your monthly payments on a SAVE plan, interest won’t be added to your loans.

For instructor Deidre Sears, teaching this class is about more than choreography.</p><p>\"I think with art itself and the performing arts, it's just a way I feel, or I believe that young people can use that as a tool and as an outlet to express themselves,\" Sears said.</p><p>Using that tool, Sears started dancing when she was 7 years old at a studio in New Jersey. The movement throughout the years helped her find herself.</p><p>\"It allowed me to really stand on my own and to find my own voice. I can say it was my therapy. Without dance, I don't know where I would be.

You know, you also have the opportunity to be able to be on that stage and make strides and as I may be an inspiration to you, you might be an inspiration to someone else.\"</p><p>During Black History Month, the Monroe County Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is honoring Sears and a few others at their annual luncheon, called The Art of Worship, later this month.</p><p>Sears Says she's humbled to be honored, and her focus remains on teaching her dance students about their culture.</p><p>\"We come from a very colorful background. We, as a people, we are very colorful people with our culture alone, the music, the food, and everything like that. It is very important to celebrate. It is very important for our children to understand the history, where it's good or bad, or to know where you came from and the ability to see where we're going.\"</p><p>Sears says she'll continue empowering and helping dancers of all ages and ethnicities find their voice through movement.</p>"

The same name has also been falsely linked to recent incidents in other areas and there’s no evidence anyone with that name even exists. </p><p>Two adults have been charged with murder in connection with the Kansas City parade shooting.

Vern Buchanan</a> first introduced a bill called The Sunshine Protection Act in March 2018. But the bill never made it to a vote of the full Senate or House. </p><p>If it had passed, the bill would have made daylight saving time the “new, permanent standard time” throughout the country. That means we wouldn’t change our clocks, or “fall back,” in November and would have a full year of daylight saving time instead of only eight months.</p><p>The bill has since been reintroduced several times in Congress. It gained some momentum when the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/623?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Sunshine+protection+act%22%2C%22Sunshine%22%2C%22protection%22%2C%22act%22%5D%7D&amp;s=1&amp;r=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Senate unanimously approved it in March 2022</a>, but the House of Representatives did not pass the bill and it did not become law. </p><p>The most <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/582/actions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1279/actions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">versions</a> of the Sunshine Protection Act, which were reintroduced in March 2023, stalled in Congress. </p><p>That means Americans will still change their clocks twice a year in 2024.</p><p>Federal law doesn’t allow full-time daylight saving time, so Congress needs to act before states could implement it year-round, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/transportation/daylight-saving-time-state-legislation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) explains</a>. States are allowed to exempt themselves from daylight saving time, meaning they stay in standard time for the full year.</p><p>In the last five years, 19 states have enacted legislation or passed resolutions in support of year-round daylight saving time, the NCSL says. But they can’t do anything unless Congress allows permanent daylight saving time. </p><p>Hawaii and Arizona – except for the Navajo Nation – are the only U.S. states that don’t observe daylight saving time. The territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands don’t observe daylight saving time, either. </p><p>States and territories that currently remain on year-round standard time would continue to do so if the Sunshine Protection Act is passed into law, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220331023222/https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=EAF1F94F-F52F-4D7E-8333-B713F44BCC8D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rubio said in 2022</a>.</p><p><strong>Switch between standard time and daylight saving time began over 50 years ago</strong></p><p>The U.S. hasn’t always had set rules for daylight saving time. When World War I ended in 1945, the law instating national daylight saving time was repealed so states could establish their own standard time, according to the <a href=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Feature-Stories/story/Article/1779177/daylight-saving-time-once-known-as-war-time/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense (DOD)</a>.</p><p>The lack of rules for daylight saving time led to “confusion for the transportation and broadcast industries,” the DOD said, leading Congress to pass the Uniform Time Act in 1966. The act established a national standard time and daylight saving time from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in October.</p><p>The dates to “spring” forward and “fall” back have since been changed. In 2005, former President George W. Bush implemented the current policy that extended daylight saving time by several weeks.
